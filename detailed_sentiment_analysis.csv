2023-10-03,"MCX Crude oil has exhibited a notable bearish signal in the form of a dark cloud cover candlestick pattern, resulting in a correction from its recent highs around 7884. Presently, the commodity is trading in proximity to a critical support level near 7300. 
 
Should this support level be breached and confirmed with a close below it, it could potentially trigger further selling pressure, with downside targets at 7146, followed by 7020. 
 
However, if the support manages to hold, there's a possibility of a bounce towards 7525, where a falling window resistance is situated. It's important to note that this level may attract selling interest. 
 
The overall bearish sentiment is likely to persist as long as the pattern high of 7884 remains intact. Traders should closely monitor these key levels for potential trading opportunities.

2023-10-03,"Commodity prices are pulling back, pressured by growing concerns about more rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, slowing global economic prospects and a stronger dollar.

Prices have fallen across the board, from metals to energy to agriculture, with some markets even moving to multimonth lows. Copper, for example, hit its lowest level since late May, while gold moved close to a seven-month low on Tuesday. Wheat, meanwhile, is trading at levels last seen during the height of the pandemic.

Macroeconomic headwinds are the key factor, according to analysts, with the prospect of more rate hikes from the Federal Reserve--and in turn a rising dollar-- acting as the main catalyst for the price slip.

2023-10-05,"NYMEX Crude oil recently experienced a significant downward move after breaking the neckline of a Head and Shoulders (HNS) pattern. This decline took the price below the critical support level of $85, which had previously acted as a breakout point in early September. 
Now, the $85 support-turned-resistance level is likely to play a pivotal role in the price action. There are two plausible scenarios to consider: 
1. Bullish Reversal Scenario: One possibility is a reversal in the price, potentially pushing it back up to around $88. This bullish outlook is supported by the formation of a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern. However, for this scenario to confirm, it is crucial for the bulls to maintain the price above the $85 level on a 4-hour closing basis. If this condition is met, a rebound towards the neckline at $88 becomes a feasible target. 
2. Bearish Continuation Scenario: Alternatively, there's a chance that the price may break below the low point of the HNS pattern, which stands at $84.20. If this breakdown occurs, it might negate the bullish engulfing pattern and suggest a continuation of the downtrend. In this case, the initial downside target lies near the next support level at $81.76. Beyond that, the extreme bearish target could be approximately $80.60, following the rules of the HNS pattern. 
Traders and investors should closely monitor the price action around the critical $85-84 level. It serves as a key pivot point that will determine whether the market will favor a bullish reversal or a bearish continuation.

2023-10-12,"*US CPI preview*

US consumer price index figure for September is expected to show a moderation in price pressures. As per Bloomberg estimates, US CPI is forecast to have slowed to an annual rate of 3.6% in September from 3.7% in August. On a mom basis, both US CPI and core CPI are expected to rise 0.3%, indicating a further easing in inflation.

Already, latest dovish shift in commentary by several Fed officials and less hawkish FOMC meeting minutes have skewed bets in favor of rate hike pause. According to the CME FedWatch tool, Futures markets are now pricing in just a 9% chance of a 25 bps rise at the FOMC meeting in November and a 26% chance of a hike in December compared to 41% a month ago. An upside surprise in inflation may revive bets for one more Fed rate hike while CPI figures in line with or below estimates could support the case for the Fed having finished its tightening cycle and may even¬†boost calls for the Fed to start cutting rates early next year.

2023-10-20,"**COMEX Gold eyes $2000 per t oz, despite SPDR ETF holdings at 4-year lows, US 10 year rates near 5%**

SPDR Gold ETF plunged to a fresh four-year low (the lowest since August 2019) of 848.24 tonnes on 19th October, compared with 862.37 tonnes during the previous week

Sharp decline in the ETF activity comes amid the backdrop of rising real rates in US, which is at a 15-year high of 2.47% (10-year TIPS), dampening the allure for the non-yielding bullions

**This implies that 9% uptick in gold prices from 6th October has been due to speculative safe haven bids.** Rising oil prices also raises upside risks to the inflation outlook, as middle-east accounts for almost one third of the global oil supply

**Geo-political tensions remains the major market mover. Concerns are growing that the US could be pulled into a wider conflict with the Iran led Arab nations**

COMEX Gold has recently approached the $2009 resistance level and is making another attempt to break through. If it succeeds, the price could potentially rise to the all-time highs around $2085-2090, a significant resistance level. Breaking that resistance might trigger a substantial upward movement. However, this might occur only if there is an escalation of geopolitical tensions, as the current increase in gold prices is largely attributed to the ""war premium."" It's important to note that any de-escalation in the conflict could lead to significant profit-taking, especially since the US dollar index and US bond yields remain strong due to robust economic data from the United States. While the gold chart indicates a potential upward trend, closely monitoring geopolitical developments is essential for making informed decisions in this context.

**Key Highlights**

Jewellery consumption softened slightly, down 2% y/y at 516t amid continued gold price strength. Jewellery fabrication was marginally more resilient, down 1% to 578t due to inventory build-up

Net central bank buying of 337t was the third strongest quarter in the data series, although failed to match the exceptional 459t from Q3‚Äô22

Q3 investment demand of 157t, although 56% higher y/y, was weak relative to its five-year average of 315t. Global gold ETFs lost 139t in Q3, a far smaller outflow than Q3‚Äô22 (-244t)

**Outlook**

2023-11-01,"**The Federal Reserve expected to  keep the funds rates steady for the second time**

During the November FOMC Meeting, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep the interest rates steady for the second meeting, in a range of 5.25% to 5.5% which is at a 22-year high.

Recent surge in treasury yields have contributed to a tightening of financial conditions, which a number of Fed officials believes to be acting as an alternative to rate hikes. That‚Äôs led even more hawkish members of the FOMC, like Dallas Fed‚Äôs Lorie Logan and Governor Christopher Waller, to indicate they would be patient in making rate moves.

Fed chair Jerome Powell might keep the door open for another rate hike amid resilience of US economy to the higher interest rates. Recent data showed solid job gains and a 4.9% GDP growth in Q3 2023. Better than expected PMIs, retail sales, employment cost and PCE prices also aids the hawkish stance. Powell might reiterate the need for rates to stay higher for longer and that future actions depend on incoming data.

**We might probably see some dollar weakness post the meeting, however, its likely to be short lived unless US economic data bleak.**

COMEX gold corrected after reaching a high near $2019 per troy ounce, forming a double top near $2009 per troy ounce. The price closed the week near the 200- day Simple Moving Average (SMA) 60-day SMA support around$1948 and $1938 per troy ounce respectively. According to Fibonacci retracement, the price corrected by 38% considering the rally from $1826 to $2019 per troy ounce. Despite the correction, the price remains above the falling channel that broke out in mid-October, suggesting an overall upward trend. The current fall is viewed as a corrective move, which may extend to $1920 to $1896 if the $1938 support is breached on a closing basis. However, if the support holds, the price might consolidate until the double top near $2009 per troy ounce is surpassed.

COMEX Silver underwent a correction, encountering resistance near the 200-day SMA at $23.40. The week concluded with the price settling near the critical support range of $22.20-$22. If this support holds, there is potential for a rebound. In such a scenario, an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern may develop, supporting a bullish outlook. However, should the $22 support be breached over a few consecutive daily closings, the decline could prolong. In summary, the primary trend remains upward, with the current downward movement appearing more corrective after its ascent from $20.80 to $23.80.

Dollar tumbled to 104.8 while US 10-year treasury yields slipped below 4.5% as a soft US inflation report hinted towards easing of stubbornly high price pressures.

According to seasonally adjusted numbers from the Labor Department, US consumer price index, increased 3.2% yoy and remained unchanged in October, both below expectations of 3.3% and 0.1% respectively. Flat reading can be attributed to 2.5% decline in energy prices for the month, offsetting a 0.3% increase in the food index and slowing pace of increase in Shelter costs.

This highlighted Fed's progress in taming inflation and added to bets the Fed is most likely done with rate hikes. As per CME Fedwatch tool, markets now price in a 99.7% probability of extended rate hike pause at the December meeting compared to 85.5% yesterday.

When analysing the BMD CPO (3rd month) price movements, it's evident that on the weekly chart, the price is consolidating within a channel. However, a more detailed examination of the daily chart reveals a noteworthy development‚Äîan inverse Head and Shoulders (HNS) breakout within the channel, suggesting a shift towards bullish momentum.
The target for this inverse HNS breakout is identified near 4140. Currently, the price is approaching the resistance of a descending trend line within the broader channel. In the event of a corrective dip, traders may find attractive buying opportunities around the 60-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), located near 3800-3750. These levels are crucial as they align with potential support and could serve as strategic entry points for buyers.
The validity of this bullish pattern remains intact unless the price breaches the critical support at 3623, corresponding to the right shoulder of the inverse HNS. A conclusive dip below this level would cast doubt on the bullish scenario.
In summary, the BMD CPO price is consolidating within a channel on the weekly chart, but the daily chart indicates a bullish inverse HNS breakout. The target for this breakout is 4140, and any correction towards the 60-day and 200-day SMAs around 3800-3750 may attract buying interest. The bullish outlook remains valid unless the price falls below the key support level at 3623.

Similar to soybeans, the soybean oil market has been entrenched in a downward-sloping channel, displaying a consolidative pattern since June-July 2022. The prospect of a decisive directional move hinges on a breakout either above or below this channel. Until such a breakout occurs, the market is likely to persist in a phase of consolidation.

The immediate support for soybean oil is identified around 44.30, and a crucial level to watch is the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at approximately 41.82. As long as these support levels hold, the bears are less likely to gain a significant advantage, and the consolidation phase could persist.

Conversely, there is an immediate resistance at the 60-day SMA, positioned near 57.59. Bulls may have their sights set on this level, particularly considering an inside bar formation at the support, reinforcing the bullish scenario. However, the bullish momentum might encounter resistance if the bulls struggle to surpass the 57.59 resistance on a weekly closing basis.

In summary, the soybean oil market appears to be in a consolidation phase within a downward-sloping channel. Monitoring key support levels, such as 44.30 and 41.82, and the resistance at 57.59, will be crucial for assessing potential breakout opportunities and the overall market direction.

As per the view given on the auspicious mahurat trading evening, COMEX silver found strong support around $22 per troy ounce and bounced back. As we expected, this led to the formation of an inverse Head and Shoulders (HNS) pattern, and the price broke the pattern's neckline resistance.
For the pattern to be confirmed, the price needs to close above the highest point of the breakout candle, which is around $24.07. Once this confirmation happens, we anticipate a powerful upward trend in silver, aiming for a target of $27.40.
Keep in mind that the support at the right shoulder is at $21.87. The success of the inverse HNS pattern relies on the price staying above this level. If the price drops below $21.87, it could mean a change in the positive trend we've been seeing.
In short, COMEX silver has bounced back, forming an inverse HNS pattern. Confirmation above $24.07 could signal a strong upward movement, but it's important to watch the $21.87 support; a drop below that might change the current positive outlook. Traders should stay vigilant around these levels for potential trading opportunities.

2023-11-22,"**FOMC November meeting minutes**

Policymakers agreed that the Fed ‚Äúwas in a position to proceed carefully‚Äù on whether to hike again and should condition further tightening on whether sufficient progress has been made in bringing down inflation

All officials judged it would be appropriate to keep rates at a level restricting the economy ‚Äúfor some time until inflation is clearly moving down sustainably‚Äù toward the Fed‚Äôs 2% inflation goal

Policymakers attributed rise in bond yields largely to increase in Treasury term premiums and ‚Äúpersistent changes in financial conditions‚Äù could have implications for path of rates

All officials supported the decision to hold the benchmark rate in a 5.25%-5.5% target range

Fed staff expected below-potential growth over next two years and ‚Äúroughly flat‚Äù unemployment rate through 2026

**__The November FOMC policy meeting minutes improved the conviction that Fed might pivot next year (as US economy slows), even though officials agreed to keep rates higher for longer. Cooling inflationary pressure gives the Fed the liberty to cut rates if the economic growth wanes. Because of the same reason, investors might be closely watching the pace of inflation and growth to gauge Fed‚Äôs policy trajectory__**

The validity of this pattern is supported by two weeks of closing prices above the high of the engulfing pattern. Additionally, the price has closed above a falling trend line resistance, marked by the red line.

Given these technical signals, the bulls may aim for the 747-758 zone, identified as the immediate resistance. This level is based on the second reaction point of the falling trend line. 

However, it's important to note that the pattern low is around 703.45. If the price drops below this level, it could negate the bullish pattern, suggesting a potential reversal or loss of upward momentum.

The market had been following an upward trend since the beginning of the year, marked by the breakout of an ascending triangle. However, from May 2023 onward, prices entered a consolidation phase. This consolidation was broken last week, resulting in a robust weekly and monthly close, signalling a potent bullish momentum.

According to Fibonacci extension levels, the immediate resistance stands near 63,580. If breached, the bulls may set their sights on the triangle breakout objective at approximately 67,000. The earlier resistance level of 61,850 now transforms into a crucial support and buying zone. Notably, a robust support level lies around 59,400. A drop below this level could shift the view to a more neutral stance.

In summary, the MCX Gold Price has experienced a breakout from its consolidation phase, and the technical indicators suggest a strong bullish sentiment.

It's important to note that if the price descends below this level, the validity of the pattern could be compromised, potentially signalling a change in the prevailing market dynamics.

2023-12-06,"As per the positional view given on 3rd Dec Spot $Gold spiked on Monday early morning near $2148.99 per troy ounce and witnessed a profit taking. We had mentioned that the price should close above $2090-2100 which was the triple top(see weekly chart) . We also mentioned that the price might take a temporary pause near $2130 that also happened although the spike was slightly higher due to Stop losses getting hit. However, the price did not close above $2090-2100 triggering profit booking. 
 
We had also mentioned crucial supports and buying zones near $2030, followed by $2018. This now stand true as the throwback seems to have taken support near the mentioned levels. This seems to be a good buying zone as per the inverse HNS. Additionally, a reversal support for the right shoulder is anticipated around $1931. It's important to note that if the price descends below this level, the validity of the pattern could be compromised, potentially signalling a change in the prevailing market dynamics. Till then the trend remains intact.

2024-01-17,"Stronger than expected retail sales figures from the US underpin resilient consumer spending and push back bets of aggressive rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. CME Fedwatch tool now assigns a 57% probability to a rate cut in March compared to 63% yesterday. This pushed Dollar to 103.6 while Dow Jones extended declines for a third day.

US Retail sales increased 0.6% for the month of December, beating estimates of 0.4%, on better than expected holiday shopping buoyed by a pickup in clothing and accessory stores as well as online nonstore businesses. Core retail sales jumped 0.8% last month, after an upwardly revised 0.5% instead of 0.4% as previously reported for November. 

Already, markets are growing skeptical of over optimistic rate cut wagers after hawkish comments from Fed official and ECB policymaker. Today, ECB President Christine Lagarde told Bloomberg TV in Davos that ECB is on track to get inflation back to its 2% target but victory has not yet been won.

The Federal Reserve will likely hold interest rates steady for a fourth straight meeting at a 22 year high of 5.25% - 5.5% and might downplay the odds of imminent rate cuts

Fed chair Jerome Powell might indicate that the committee is gratified by recent declines in inflation while continuing to indicate little urgency to cut, pointing to a solid labor market and an economy that‚Äôs growing strongly

Powell is likely to be pressed on whether the Fed is considering rate cuts for March and if the committee‚Äôs median forecast in December for three quarter-point reductions this year is still a good reflection of official‚Äôs views. Investors currently expect five or more cuts in 2024

The risk of a re-acceleration in inflation later this year may cause Powell to push back against any near-term rate changes. Earlier this month, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the worst outcome would be for policymakers to lower rates and have to raise them again later.

Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job gains have moderated since early last year but remain strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated.

The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance.

This is a major change from the December statement as the FOMC removed language that had indicated a willingness to keep raising interest rates until inflation had been brought under control and was on its way toward the Fed's 2% inflation goal.¬†

After the release of hotter than expected CPI and PPI for January, Fed‚Äôs preferred PCE price inflation is also expected to see an increase in January.

The core PCE is seen rising 0.4% m/m (vs 0.2% in Dec), the second straight monthly acceleration in a gauge that‚Äôs largely been receding over the past two years. However, base effects might lead to a decline in y/y numbers.

According to Bloomberg forecasts, personal spending is expected to increase 0.4% m/m driven by strong hiring in Jan, while personal spending growth likely slowed amid frigid weather.

Bond traders no longer expect the Fed to lower rates by more than 75 bps in 2024, adjusting their bets in line with the Fed‚Äôs December dot plot. According to CME Fedwatch tool, the odds of a quarter point rate cut in June stands at 49.4%.

Hotter than expected PCE data might prompt investors to pare rate cut bets further, aiding the treasury yields, while lower than expected inflation might weigh down on dollar and yields.

LME Copper had a muted reaction to CSPT update and edged below $8900/tonne. China's top copper smelters have reportedly proposed a production cut of 5% to 10% and decided not to issue guidance prices for copper processing charges for the second quarter.

Output reduction would be applied to existing production plans for 2024 and smelters will next discuss individually about exact scope of cuts.

Since the announcement lacked specifics and as spot TCs are expected to recover in the second quarter as smelters start maintenance, it did not elicit a major response.

Now, Copper prices may be influenced by US data. Since UK, US and Indian markets are closed on Friday for Good Friday, we may see the impact of most keenly awaited Core PCE data on Monday. This might keep traders wary and Copper move limited to a narrow range in today's session.

2024-04-05,"The CBOT Soybean front month continuous chart reflects a notable uptrend from 2020 to 2022, albeit with a corrective dip in 2021, followed by a surge to new highs around 1750. However, starting from June 2022, the price has entered a retracement phase, encompassing more than a 61.8% retracement of its prior move from 800 to 1750.

Observing a potential harmonic pattern, specifically the 5-0 pattern, it appears that the price has completed the 0X, XA, and AB legs. This completion suggests a potential next leg, BC, which could surpass previous highs, as indicated in the chart analysis. Notably, a critical support zone lies approximately between 1122-1080, pivotal for initiating the BC leg upward.

It's imperative to monitor the integrity of this support zone, as a breach could invalidate the 5-0 pattern, possibly leading to further downward movement in prices. Therefore, maintaining the support zone is crucial for the anticipated continuation of the upward trend.

2024-04-05,"CBOT Soybean Oil is currently trading within a falling wedge pattern, having found support at the double bottom level around 44.50, as previously noted. Falling wedges typically signal a bullish pattern, with confirmation usually seen upon a breakout above the upper boundary. As of now, there remains considerable distance to cover before such a breakout occurs.

It's crucial to remain vigilant of the support zone near 44.50-44, as a close below this level could potentially lead to a further decline towards 40.95. However, given the underlying bullish primary trend, the preferred outlook leans towards the bullish side, with confirmation expected upon a breakout from the falling wedge pattern.

Traders should closely monitor price action and await a clear break above the upper boundary of the falling wedge for confirmation of the anticipated bullish continuation.

Traders' expectations for rate cuts by the Fed have dwindled from six or seven to barely two by the end of 2024. However, the lingering anticipation of Fed generosity, especially during an election year, sustains hopes for further rate reductions.

The global market finds itself in an unprecedented situation where the US rate cycle remains stagnant despite widespread anticipation of substantial rate cuts, leaving markets ill-prepared for potential shifts.

2024-04-19,"**Amidst the chatter on media and social media about Iran's potential to close the Straits of Hormuz, it's crucial to consider the complexities and ramifications of such a scenario. The Strait serves as a vital international shipping lane, facilitating the transportation of a substantial portion of the world's oil and gas supply.

However, the notion of Iran easily shutting down the Strait overlooks several key factors. Firstly, the Strait's status as an international waterway means that any attempt by Iran to disrupt its operations would likely be perceived as a form of blackmail by the global community. Such aggressive military action could trigger serious repercussions and potentially prompt the involvement of multinational forces.

Moreover, it's essential to recognize that the issue of the Strait of Hormuz is distinct from the Israeli context. While tensions in the region are multifaceted, any Iranian aggression towards the Strait would primarily be viewed through the lens of international security and maritime commerce, rather than direct ties to Israel.

In essence, the prospect of Iran attacking the Strait of Hormuz represents a significant escalation in geopolitical tensions. Such a move would not only disrupt global energy markets but also provoke a unified response from the international community. Thus, while Iran may possess the capability to interfere with the Strait's operations, the potential consequences of such actions make it a risky and challenging endeavor.**",telegram,positive,0.716172456741333,0.4205420243167877,0.4205420243167877,0.57720405,0.6597,0.0,1.0,1,0

2024-04-19,"LME Copper has rallied 14% so far this year and currently trades near the highest levels in 22 months. While Copper mostly remained below $8500/tonne till mid-March, steep decline in treatment and refining charges (TCs/RCs) drew markets‚Äô attention towards tightness in concentrate markets.

¬∑         CSPT had previously set first-quarter guidance of $80 per tonne and 8.0 cents per pound, same level agreed between Chilean miner Antofagasta and China‚Äôs Jinchuan Group in November 2023 for their 2024 contracts. Decline in TC/RCs accelerated in March, with copper concentrate trading at levels more than 90% lower in the spot market than six months ago.

¬∑         As per Bloomberg reports, Cargoes of copper concentrate from BHP Group Ltd.‚Äôs giant Escondida mine in Chile changed hands recently at terms as low as $12 a metric ton and 1.2 cents a pound to Chinese smelters, and at $3 and 0.3 cents to at least one trader, according to people familiar with the deals.

¬∑         Fastmarkets weekly Index shows Spot copper TCs in China plunged to an all-time low of $0.10 per tonne on April 12, down from $2.30 per tonne the prior week, and $11.20 per ton on March 11.

¬∑         Copper concentrate charges, reportedly lowest in at least a decade, can primarily be attributed to supply setbacks at global mines (most significant being closure of First Quantum‚Äôs Cobre Panama mine last November) and rapid expansion of copper smelting capacity.

¬∑         Near zero processing fees prompted China‚Äôs top smelters to reach an agreement to lower operation rates, adjust maintenance plans and postpone new projects. At the quarterly meeting of the Copper Smelters Purchasing Team, thirteen major smelters proposed a reduction of 5% to 10% in planned output this year.

¬∑         Copper runs hot boosted further by bets that LME and CME ban on newly produced Russian aluminum, copper and nickel may reduce Russian flows to Western markets and drive Chinese imports even higher. Latest data from the General Administration of Customs data showed Imports of unwrought copper and products in China, rose 16% in March to 474,000 metric tons, from 408,174 tons in the same month a year earlier.

¬∑         As per the new sanctions, Aluminium, copper and nickel made in Russia on or after April 13, 2024 will not be accepted for delivery to LME-registered warehouses or CME-owned facilities. LME Cancelled warrants or stocks earmarked for delivery rose from 14.7% on Wednesday to 26.5% on Thursday.

¬∑         At present, LME Copper prices trades near $9800/tonne after hitting a fresh 22-month high of $9843/tonne earlier in the session buoyed by rising inventory cancellations on the LME and signs that Chinese smelters are actually complying with pledges to cut output by 5%-10% in the face of tighter-than-expected concentrate supply and overcapacity.

¬∑         Latest data from high frequency data provider Earthi global copper monitoring index shows smelter inactivity in China rose to an average of 8.5%, compared with 4.1% in the first quarter of 2023 and 4% in the same quarter the year before.

¬∑         Chilean miner Antofagasta expects refined copper market to be in a deficit of 200,000-300000 tonnes in 2024, taking into consideration improving demand and revisions to production seen toward the end of 2023. On the other hand, soaring demand for the metal in electric vehicles, solar panels and Artificial Intelligence technologies boosts consumption outlook.

¬∑         To put things into perspective, CRU Group estimates copper usage of 51-56 kgs in an average EV between this year and 2030, nearly three times the amount used in a typical combustion engine vehicle. Similarly, International Energy Agency (IEA) expects annual global copper demand in the solar PV sector specifically to increase from 756.8kt (kilotons) in 2022 to a peak of 2,062.5kt in 2035, and down to 1,879.8kt in 2050. Overall, supply side concerns coupled with fresh demand triggers signals that the red metal has a green future.

2024-04-29,"__We've conducted scenario analyses on core US inflation, considering various projected month-over-month (MoM) rates. Here are the three scenarios we've outlined:__

**Base Scenario (0.31% MoM):**

This scenario is based on the average MoM rate of the last 12 months, which stands at 0.31%. If this rate persists until December, the Federal Reserve (Fed) might find grounds for a rate cut, possibly up to 1%, with a potential stretch to 2% in an election year.


**Worse case Scenario (0.50% MoM):**

In this scenario, we consider a rate around 0.50% MoM, slightly below the recent three-month average. If core inflation reaches this level, the likelihood of rate hikes could increase, presenting a less favorable outlook for markets. This scenario represents a potentially challenging situation.


**Optimistic Scenario (0.10% MoM):**

The lowest MoM rate observed over the last 27 months is 0.10%. If we assume this rate, there's significant room for the Fed to implement substantial rate cuts. This scenario represents an optimistic outlook.

Looking ahead, it's crucial to monitor estimates for US core CPI inflation closely. If the rate estimates and actual figures hover below 0.30%, it could signal positive news for risk assets, as rates may decrease. Conversely, if they exceed 0.40%, it could spell trouble for risk assets but potentially favor the dollar and yields. Stay vigilant for fluctuations in US core CPI inflation as they could significantly impact market dynamics.

2024-05-31,"Market sentiment improved as US PCE figures for April hinted at progress, albeit gradual, towards the Fed‚Äôs inflation target. PCE inflation stood at 2.7% yoy and rose by 0.3% from the previous month, while Core PCE increased by 0.2% mom and 2.8% year-on-year, aligning with forecasts. Personal income saw a 0.3% increase for the month, in line with estimates, while spending fell short of forecasts, rising only by 0.2% in April. This was primarily due to a 0.4% decrease in spending on goods and a mere 0.1% rise in services expenditures. Following the PCE numbers, dollar slipped to 104.38 and is set to close May ~1.7% lower, marking its first monthly decline in 2024.

However, this can only be viewed as temporary relief, considering that price pressures remain elevated and still significantly below the Fed‚Äôs 2% target. Probability of the first cut likely not occurring until November remains unchanged, indicates limited upside in commodity prices.

2024-06-25,"*Jeera Update*

Jeera futures rose more than 12.5% in June, boosted by strong local and international demand as supplies fell.

Prices have risen more than 45% from a low of Rs. 20,270 in April to around Rs. 29,800 per 100 kg today.

In June, jeera arrivals in the physical market totaled 24,450 tons, down 46% from 46,000 tons in May, as growers hoarded supplies in expectation of future price increases.

Jeera exports have been high this year, with the largest export volume ever recorded for the month of April at 39,200 tonnes. Exports in the first four months of 2024 were 97,550 tons, up from 57,500 tons in the same months last year.

Going forward, the key resistance is 29,870, which is the current year's high. If it remains above this level, we may see prices rise to 31,500 and eventually to 32,905. However, the critical support level on the downward side is 29,100. If it breaks below this support, prices may fall to 28,000 and 27,100.

The gap between Old crop price and New crop price is filled today (02-Jul-2024). 

There is an expectation of prices recovery from the marked demand zone and thus need to observe price action in this zone. 

However, if it breaks below the demand zone then the prices may trade lower towards 6,820 levels.

""The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra.""**



1Ô∏è‚É£ **GOLD: ‚ÄúI want to break free‚Äù**

__**Trend**: Bullish. Better to buy on decline for positional traders, than chase momentum. 

**Support levels: **72,150 & 71,850

**Resistance levels: **72,850 and 73,500.__

Last night, dollar bulls faced two setbacks. First, the ADP private sector job survey showed a gain of 150K jobs in June, slightly below the forecast of 165K. Additionally, the ISM services sector survey, a key component of the US economy, revealed a broad-based slowdown, indicating a potential deceleration in the US economy, which could affect job and wage growth. The third crucial data point, the US NFP employment report, is set to be released tomorrow. If it also comes in weaker than expected, bullion bulls might transition from singing Queen‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Want to Break Free‚Äù to R. Kelly‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Believe I Can Fly.‚Äù

Given the current economic indicators, traders should consider a strategy of buying on dips, as the path of least resistance appears upward. With US yields softening and the dollar losing strength, the bias remains bullish as long as prices stay above the 71,600 level. Multiple support levels are present between 71,850 and 72,150. Key resistance levels to watch are near 72,850-72,875, followed by 73,500.



2Ô∏è‚É£ **Silver: ""Don't Stop Me Now""**

__**Trend: **Bullish. Better to buy on decline for positional traders, than chase momentum. 

**Support levels: **91,400 & 90,600.

**Resistance levels:** 92,200 and 94,000.__

Silver bulls are currently benefiting from several positive factors. Initially, copper broke out of its multi-week consolidation, followed by gold yesterday. Similarly, both MCX and Comex silver have broken out of their downward sloping channels, indicating potential ignition and momentum ahead.

In terms of technical levels, prices may encounter resistance around 92,200. However, surpassing this level could pave the way for silver to target resistance levels at 94,000 and 96,450. The bias remains upward as long as prices hold above 89,800, with key support levels identified at 91,400 and 90,600.



3Ô∏è‚É£** Crude Oil: Need to pause.**

__**Trend: **Upward but needs more consolidation. 

**Support levels:** 6880 & 6820.

**Resistance levels:** 7070 and 7100.__

Crude oil prices have entered a consolidation phase following a 15% rally from June lows. Yesterday's substantial inventory draw suggests support, with traders betting on supply tightening from OPEC cuts and refineries restarting after planned shutdowns. Demand is showing signs of improvement, adding further momentum.

Despite these bullish factors, a period of consolidation seems justified. Prices are currently approaching a significant resistance zone around 7070/7100 levels. The bias remains bullish as long as prices remain above 6800, a crucial support level.



4Ô∏è‚É£ **Natural Gas: Oversold but weak**

__**Trend:** Bearish but oversold. 

**Support levels:** 220 & 195

**Resistance levels:** 215 and 220.__

The summer weather forecast predicts hotter conditions in the US, potentially increasing demand for gas due to heightened cooling needs. However, elevated inventory levels and a supply response following a significant rally in gas prices during the first half of 2024 have led to a sharp decline in prices. Currently, traders should exercise caution as most of the long liquidation phase appears to be complete, with market sentiment shifting towards short positions.

Given the volatility, any sudden weather pattern changes could trigger a short squeeze. Therefore, our approach to the gas market now is day-to-day, avoiding overnight positions.

 In recent sessions, prices have stalled around the 200 mark, with expected support near the 195/197 zone. A clear break below 195 could signal a bearish trend towards a target of 180. However, as long as the 195/197 support holds, there's potential for a short-covering bounce towards 215/220 levels.",telegram,positive,0.9304460883140564,0.16187848804950716,0.16187848804950716,-0.040963024,0.9118,0.0,1.0,1,0

__
**Trend:** Bullish. 

**Support levels: **853 & 845.

**Resistance levels: **876 and 880.__

Copper continues to progress in the expected direction, having surpassed the 860-resistance level and now targeting 880. However, the upward movement may not be linear, as traders are cautious due to recent memories of significant liquidations at higher price levels. Thus, we could see a pattern of two steps forward and one step back.

Several factors are supporting copper's rise, including inventory draws from exchanges, a weaker US dollar, and optimistic expectations surrounding the upcoming Chinese plenum. The bias remains upward, suggesting a strategy of buying on dips as long as prices remain above 845/846 support levels.

Nonfarm payrolls beats expectations while unemployment rate surged to the highest in nearly three years. 

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 206,000 for the month, better than the 190,000 Bloomberg forecast though less than the downwardly revised gain of 218,000 in May, which was cut sharply from the initial estimate of 272,000. unemployment rate unexpectedly climbed to 4.1%, highest level since November 2021. Wage inflation met expectations as average hourly earnings increased 0.3% for the month and 3.9% from a year ago, both in line with estimates. 

Overall, the report does suggest a softening labor market and added to bets of a September rate cut.  CME Fedwatch tool now shows 73% probability of September rate cut, up from 68% yesterday. So, we may see weakness in dollar and uptick in commodities.

1Ô∏è‚É£ **GOLD: ‚ÄúFollow through buying is needed‚Äù**

__Trend: Bullish. Better to buy on decline for positional traders, than chase momentum. 

Support levels: 72,500 & 72,350

Resistance levels: 73,500 and 74,000.__

As anticipated, gold prices surged last week after breaking free from a multi-week consolidation and downward correction. Recent U.S. economic data has been weaker than expected, with manufacturing and services sector surveys indicating a sharp slowdown in activities. Although the job market continues to add jobs at a strong pace, there has been a gradual weakening in the labor sector, which persisted in June. Consequently, U.S. yields dropped, and the U.S. Dollar fell, driving gold prices upward.

This week, key events to watch will be the U.S. Fed Chief‚Äôs testimony and CPI inflation data. Traders expect the Fed to start lowering rates in September, with a total reduction of 50 basis points by December. The market will closely analyze these events to assess whether they increase or decrease the likelihood of a rate cut. Gold remains in an uptrend, and traders looking to buy on dips should consider doing so on declines, ensuring to maintain a stop below the 72,250 level. Resistance is near 73,500-73,550, with the all-time high close to 74,450.



**2Ô∏è‚É£ Silver: ""Momentum needs to continue""**

__Trend: Bullish. Better to buy on decline for positional traders, than chase momentum. 
Support levels: 92,500 & 92,000.
Resistance levels: 94,200 and 96,550.__

Similar to gold, we anticipated the breakout move in silver prices as well. Silver prices are influenced by both gold and copper prices. With both of these drivers on strong footing, silver prices are likely to continue moving higher. Buying on declines is advised, but it's important to maintain a stop below 91,400 on an hourly closing basis. Resistance is near 94,200, followed by 96,550-96,600.



3Ô∏è‚É£ **Crude Oil: ‚ÄúCaught within a love triangle between bulls and bears‚Äù**

__Trend: Upward but needs more consolidation. 
Support levels: 6880 & 6820.
Resistance levels: 7050 and 7100.__

Crude oil will be a challenging commodity to trade this week. Following a 16% rally since early June, momentum remains overbought. Although a hurricane is expected to make landfall, it is not anticipated to cause significant disruption to oil flows. Typically, oil prices rise in anticipation of a major hurricane but tend to reverse and fall once the storm passes. This is due to the evaporation of the hurricane premium and oil stocks piling up in Cushing as refineries in the hurricane's path temporarily shut down. Consequently, traders need to be extremely flexible when trading oil during such events.



**4Ô∏è‚É£Natural Gas: ‚ÄúI am sinking baby‚Äù**
__
Trend: Bearish but oversold. 
Support levels: 180 & 164.
Resistance levels: 210 and 221.__

The summer weather forecast predicts hotter conditions in the US, potentially increasing demand for gas due to heightened cooling needs. However, elevated inventory levels and a supply response following a significant rally in gas prices during the first half of 2024 have led to a sharp decline in prices. Currently, traders should exercise caution as most of the long liquidation phase appears to be complete, with market sentiment shifting towards short positions.

Given the volatility, any sudden changes in weather patterns could trigger a short squeeze. Therefore, our approach to the gas market now is day-to-day, avoiding overnight positions. In recent sessions, prices have continued to fall from around 261 to the current 195. We expect prices to drop further towards the 180 level, and beyond that,

it may even test the 161-164 zone. Although many traders may be tempted to fade the drop due to the oversold nature of momentum, this can be detrimental to your financial health. It is better to look for trades in the direction of the ongoing strong trend, but with proper stop losses. Key resistance is near 210 and the 221-224 zone.

**GOLD: ‚ÄúHealthy price pullback‚Äù**

__Positional trend: Bullish
Support levels: 72,200 & 72,100
Resistance levels: 73,500 and 74,000
__
Gold experienced a significant pullback yesterday, primarily driven by long liquidation. This decline may be attributed to the news that the Chinese central bank has paused its gold-buying activity for the second consecutive month in June. This week's focus will be on the US Fed Chairman's testimony to Congress and the US retail inflation data.

The recent drop in gold prices appears to be a profit-taking pullback within a broader uptrend. Therefore, our positional outlook remains bullish. The key support level that bulls need to defend is yesterday's low, around 72,100. If this level is breached, it is advisable to move to the sidelines and reassess the situation. On the upside, the key resistance levels to watch are 72,850 and 73,500.


**
Silver: ""Price pullback an opportunity for bulls""**

__Positional trend: Bullish 
Support levels: 92,500 & 92,000
Resistance levels: 94,200 and 96,550
__
Similar to gold, silver prices also dropped due to profit-taking. However, silver's rebound has been significantly quicker, demonstrating strong relative outperformance compared to gold. Traders with a higher risk appetite may find silver more attractive than gold. Silver offers a diversified play on bullion, currencies, and base metals.

As long as the US Dollar continues to weaken and base metals rise, stronger gold prices should sustain silver's relative outperformance. However, traders must exercise flexibility and robust risk management to navigate silver's high volatility. Indiscipline in this market can be very costly.

Our positional view on silver remains bullish. The key support level that silver bulls need to defend is yesterday's low of 91,850/900. If this level is breached, it is advisable to move to the sidelines and reassess the situation. On the upside, the key resistance levels to watch are 94,200 and 96,550.


**
Crude Oil: ‚ÄúOn calmer waters‚Äù**

__Positional trend: Neutral. Focus on range play strategies
Support levels: 6800 & 6700.
Resistance levels: 6900 and 7050.__

As we anticipated, the risk of a post-hurricane price drop seems to be materializing. Tropical Storm Beryl, which initially made landfall in Texas as a Category 1 hurricane, has been downgraded due to decreased wind speeds and now appears set to dissipate without impacting US domestic crude oil production. The market bias is now neutral, with no fresh triggers likely to drive prices significantly in either direction.

Key levels to watch are 6800 and 6700 on the downside, and 6900 and 7050/80 on the upside. Traders can play this broad range of 6700/6800 to 7050/80 for the next few days. For short positions, place stops above the range high, and for long positions, place stops below the range low. Additionally, straddle and strangle shorts can be executed via crude oil options, but it's crucial to maintain adequate stop losses. For traders with lower risk appetites, consider hedged strategies like short iron fly strategies.

__Positional trend: Bearish but witnessing a counter trend rebound 
Support levels: 196 & 182.
Resistance levels: 203 and 207.__

After eight consecutive sessions where prices consistently breached the previous day's low and closed below it, we observed a tentative attempt at short covering yesterday. While this attempt remains modest, the market appears to be oversold. We could witness significant short covering as LNG exports resume post-hurricane disruptions. Although the cooling impact from hurricane rains may temper this effect, it is unlikely to prevent a short covering bounce from these oversold levels.

If prices sustain above the 196 level, there is potential for a short squeeze, with prices possibly testing the 203 level and even reaching the 206/207 range. This movement can be seen as a corrective rise within a broader downtrend. However, a decisive break below the 196 level would be negative, likely resuming the downtrend and opening the possibility of prices falling to the 180/182 zone in futures.



**Copper: ‚ÄúConsolidating‚Äù**

__Positional trend: Upward
Support levels: 860 & 846
Resistance levels: 883 and 895.__

Copper may be entering a period of sideways consolidation following a sharp recovery over the past few days. We expect prices to oscillate within a range of 865 to 885. While the overall trend remains positive, it's important to monitor LME inventory levels, which are released around 1:30 pm. Over the past week, inventory drawdowns and an increase in cancelled warrants as a percentage of overall inventory suggest higher demand for metal in LME warehouses, supporting bullish sentiment.

Shanghai Futures Exchange inventory data is released every Friday, so it won't significantly impact prices in the near term. However, keeping a close watch on Comex inventory levels is also crucial. Therefore, while the price structure for copper appears bullish, a consolidation phase is underway. As long as prices hold above 860, the positional bullish bias remains intact.

Dollar fell to a five-week low of 104.08 and US 10-year Treasury yields dropped to 4.17%, weighed down by softer US inflation data that increased expectations of a rate cut in September.

US Core Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.1% month-over-month, marking its smallest increase since August 2021, and increased by 3.3% year-over-year, the slowest pace in over three years. According to Bloomberg reports, Fed swaps indicate a growing anticipation of further easing measures in 2024, and are now nearly fully pricing in a rate reduction in September.¬†Odds of a September rate cut rose to greater than 80% following the CPI data, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

The evidence of inflation trending downward again, following a spike earlier this year, coupled with Fed Chair Powell's remarks that the central bank does not necessarily require inflation to drop below 2% before considering rate cuts, has strengthened market confidence in an imminent shift in Fed policy.

On the commodities front, Comex Gold jumped by 1.5% while Silver rallied 3% while gains in metals were limited to 1%. Copper is the exception in the metals counter as it remained under pressure and currently trades 0.6% lower as elevated stocks at both LME and ShFE warehouses hints towards softer demand and increased flows from China. Also, WTI crude oil edged lower as International Energy Agency trimmed its forecast for oil-demand growth to 980,000 bpd next year from 1 million bpd while raising supply estimates.

Now, Bullion may see further upside owing to weaker dollar and declining treasury yields while metals may see limited gains or even trend lower on caution ahead of China‚Äôs Third Plenum next week.

US Core CPI rose by 0.1% month-over-month, marking its smallest increase since August 2021, and increased by 3.3% year-over-year, the slowest pace in over three years

WTI crude extends gains for a third day bouyed by signs of improved fuel demand in the US over the summer travel season and hopes of an imminent Fed pivot

LME base metals extends declines as China trade data highlights lackluster domestic demand and keep markets wary ahead of GDP numbers and key government plenum next week 

China‚Äôs imports fell by 2.3% in June from a year ago in U.S. dollar terms while exports for June climbed by 8.6% year on year, beating expectations

Today, US PPI, Prelim UoM consumer sentiment and inflation expectations will be in focus

Copper prices fell on Tuesday as weak economic data from top consumer China and rising inventories in most global warehouses pressured demand outlook for the metal.

Copper inventories in LME-approved warehouses, Comex warehouses, bonded warehouses in China as well as warehouses designated by the Shanghai International Energy Exchange increased so far in July, pointing to weak demand.

China's economy grew much slower than expected in the second quarter, painting a weak demand picture as the country accounts for around half of copper demand annually.

2024-07-17,"**Gold Update**

Comex gold surged to an all-time high of $2387.39 per ounce following recent statements from Fed Chair and FOMC officials, which bolstered expectations of a rate cut in September.

In addition, reports that China's gold share of its overall reserves (including reserve position and SDRs at the IMF), despite a record high of 4.9%, remain low compared to the global average of 16%. This suggests potential for increased official gold purchases, reflecting strong appetite.

Despite better-than-expected US retail sales figures, market expectations for a rate cut persisted. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently expressed increased confidence in achieving the central bank‚Äôs 2% inflation target based on second-quarter economic data, potentially paving the way for imminent interest-rate cuts. San Francisco Fed Bank President Mary Daly echoed this sentiment, indicating growing confidence in inflation reaching the Fed's goal.

These factors, alongside geopolitical tensions and the upcoming US elections, may continue to support elevated gold prices.

hitting this year‚Äôs development goals, which include an annual
growth target of about 5% ‚Äî a commitment that comes days after

‚ÄúHigh-quality development is the top mission of building a
modern socialist country,‚Äù the official Xinhua News Agency said.
That vague slogan is typically used to signal the Chinese
leader‚Äôs desire to build a society driven by advanced technology
that gives Beijing resilience against US trade curbs.  

The twice-a-decade meeting‚Äôs emphasis on high-quality
growth implied ‚Äúno expansionary policy to promote the quantity
of growth,‚Äù said Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho
Bank. ‚ÄúThe meeting touched the tasks of preventing and resolving
the property market risks, without making any surprising
measures to stabilize the housing market,‚Äù he added.

The ruling party normally issues a more detailed report
several days after concluding the Third Plenum. Specific
policies taking cues from the meeting are more likely to come
from a sit-down of China‚Äôs 24-man Politburo later this month,
which typically focuses on economic issues for the year.

Comex gold prices held above the last session closing, but still trading below $2,400 per troy ounce, as markets moved beyond the uncertainty in the US to critical economic data due this week, which might define the future of Federal Reserve monetary policy.

WTI Crude Oil was steady near a six-week low as traders waited for fresh clues on market balances, including the outlook for US stockpiles. Global benchmark Brent held above $82 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate was near $78.

MCX Gold and Silver prices faced significant selling pressure following a reduction in basic customs duty from 10% to 5%, and a decrease in AIDC from 5% to 1%, resulting in a total import duty of 6%. This move has led to a sharp decline in prices, with Gold down by Rs. 4000/10 grams and Silver plummeting by Rs. 4090/kg. 

While cheaper prices may stimulate domestic demand in the medium term, short-term trends could be influenced by Federal Reserve policy decisions. There remains potential for further downside, given the unexpectedly high import duty cut.

Overall, while the data does not change market expectations for a rate cut, it provides relief by easing concerns that the Fed might need to hastily reduce rates to prevent a recession and hence helps Dollar remain steady near 104.4.

While on the other hand, gold prices hold declines and are trading near $2370 per ounce amid profit booking and a preference for the Yen as a safe haven asset amidst a US tech selloff and Chinese economic concerns. Additionally, anticipation builds ahead of the BoJ's monetary policy decision next week, with Japan potentially tightening policy, in contrast to expected rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.

As anticipated, a breakout from the symmetrical triangle has occurred, indicating a potential uptrend in NCDEX Guar Aug 2024 seed prices.

Our analysis suggests that prices are likely to go higher towards the 5,950-6,000 levels, provided it successfully sustain above the 5,600 levels on a daily basis.

The 5,570 / 5,600 levels has emerged as a crucial support zone, and any pullback to these level may present a favorable buying opportunity for investors targeting the aforementioned levels.

2024-07-31,"**Metals Rally as Dollar Weakens and Traders Bet on China Stimulus (Bloomberg)**

Copper jumped more than 2% from its lowest close in four months as the dollar weakened and bearish Chinese factory data boosted hopes that Beijing will ramp up stimulus for its struggling economy. 

The nation‚Äôs factory activity shrank for a third straight month in July, extending the weakness in manufacturing that‚Äôs weighed on metals prices. Onshore investors appeared to take the
latest downbeat data as a harbinger of more stimulus, with Chinese equities enjoying their best day since April.

A weakening dollar also lent support to commodities priced
in the currency, with a rate hike by Japan‚Äôs central bank putting pressure on the greenback. All industrial metals gained as the yen rallied 1.8% against the dollar while China‚Äôs yuan rose 0.3%.

Disappointing demand from China has offered a powerful headwind for metals markets that began 2024 on relatively bullish note. Copper ‚Äî which reached a record in May ‚Äî on Tuesday closed at its lowest level in nearly four months.

Although there are tentative signs that Chinese buyers are returning to the market. The factory data comes the day after China‚Äôs top leaders recognized difficulties in the economy and pledged more steps to reboot sputtering growth. Separately, major global miner Rio
Tinto Group said demand for its products from China remained
‚Äúfairly robust and stable.‚Äù",telegram,positive,0.9207330346107483,0.14049388509631155,0.14049388509631155,-0.04669223,-0.6808,1.0,1.0,0,0

The unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, higher than the anticipated 4.1% and marking the highest level in nearly three years.

2024-08-02,"**YEN CARRY TRADE**


**What is a Yen Carry Trade?**

Ans:

A Yen carry trade involves borrowing in Japanese Yen, which typically has low-interest rates and a weak currency. Hedge funds and other investors borrow in Yen and then sell the Yen to buy other currencies, using the proceeds to invest in various risky assets such as commodities and equities. As long as the Yen depreciates or remains stable and interest rates stay low, the carry trade is advantageous. Investors not only earn returns from the invested assets but also benefit from the weak Yen. This strategy can amplify both the weakness in the Yen and the strength in the asset classes being invested in as more traders participate.



**What Happens During the Unwinding of a Carry Trade?**

Ans:

When the Japanese Yen begins to appreciate, the carry trade becomes less profitable. Hedge funds and retail traders who have engaged in the carry trade start to cut their losses by reversing their trades. They sell the assets in which they invested and buy back Yen. This increases the demand for Yen, driving its value higher and causing the prices of risky assets to fall. This process can create a domino effect, leading to a sharp decline in risky assets and a significant rise in the Yen.



**Current Trends in Commodities**


Recently, Japanese domestic traders have been buying gold, silver, copper, and foreign equities to protect against a very weak Yen. The Yen had depreciated by nearly 16% against the USD this year before it peaked near 162 in USD/JPY terms. Additionally, hedge funds have likely engaged in Yen carry trades due to the weak Yen. The sharp rise in the Yen over the past 10 days may have triggered unwinding from these traders.


**Conclusion**

Therefore, it is essential to keep an eye on the USD/JPY exchange rate in the short term if you are trading commodities. The movements in this currency pair can significantly impact the performance of commodities.

COMEX Gold prices rebounded above $2,495/oz after a decline, as investors analyzed the US CPI data. 

The July CPI report showed a moderation in consumer inflation to 2.9%, below expectations, while the core rate declined to a three-year low. Despite this, market expectations of a September rate cut remain intact, but with diminished prospects of a larger reduction.

Gold's upward momentum was tempered by the CPI data, but it continues to benefit from its safe-haven appeal amid Middle East tensions. 

Investors remain cautious about potential retaliatory actions by Iran against Israel, supporting gold prices.

NCDEX Castor Seed futures are trading above the 20-day EMA and currently trading below the resistance zone of 6300/6350. 

A breakout above this zone could propel prices towards 6690 and potentially 7000, provided the momentum sustains above 6500. 

Conversely, failure to breach the resistance zone may lead to a decline towards the immediate support at 6190, followed by 6000. 

Sustained trade below 6000 could exacerbate the downturn, targeting the support zone of 5910/5850.

Ultimately, 5670 serves as the last line of defense, below which further weakness may unfold. 

Note: Traders should closely monitor price action near the resistance zone.

*COMEX Gold surged to a record high of $2,538.7 per ounce* driven by strong demand for safe-haven assets amid geopolitical tensions and economic concerns. 

Market fears were heightened by the potential for retaliatory strikes from Iran following Israel's attack on Hamas officials in Iranian territory.

Additionally, the escalating conflict between Ukraine and Russia added to global uncertainty. 

On the economic front, the U.S. housing market showed signs of stress, with both housing starts and building permits hitting four-year lows. 

Despite strong retail sales, markets are still widely expecting the Federal Reserve to implement 100 basis points in rate cuts over the remaining decisions this year.

2024-08-21,"*The US Federal Reserve's July meeting minutes, scheduled for release on today, Wednesday, 11:30 pm IST may reinforce expectations of impending interest rate cuts*

Investors will closely examine the discussions on policy easing and economic outlook. Although the Fed maintained its policy settings in July, Chairman Jerome Powell's comments hinted at a possible rate cut in September. 

The recent jobs report showed a cooling labor market, further supporting the case for a rate cut. 

Markets have priced in a 25 basis point rate cut in September, with a 50 basis point cut also considered possible. 

A rate cut could lead to a weaker dollar, making gold more attractive to investors and potentially driving up prices. 

Conversely, a smaller rate cut or no cut at all could lead to a stronger dollar, putting downward pressure on gold prices. 

The minutes will provide valuable insight into the Fed's decision-making process and may influence gold prices accordingly.

Today, COMEX Gold fell to around $2,528 per ounce but recovered to trade currently near $ 2,541, after hitting an all-time high of $2,570.4 in the previous session.

""Confidence without clarity can be disastrous‚Äù


**GOLD**

__Intra day bias: Corrective within a broad uptrend.
Support levels: 71,300 & 70,600
Resistance levels: 72,320 and 73,000__

The market's intraday trend may experience downward corrections within a broader upward trend. Buying on dips is advisable as long as prices remain above 71,300, with the positional trend staying bullish above 70,600. Key resistance levels are at 72,320 and 73,000. Today is expected to be less volatile, with a likelihood of consolidation, particularly in the US Dollar Index and precious metals like gold and silver.



**SILVER**

__Intra day bias: Consolidation within a broad uptrend.
Support levels: 84,000 & 83,500
Resistance levels: 86,450 and 87,100__

With no major macroeconomic releases from the US or Europe, silver prices may take direction from its two key drivers: gold and copper. While the broader trend for silver remains upward, consolidation in gold could lead to similar behavior in silver. However, if copper prices continue their upward momentum, silver is likely to outperform gold and drift higher. The buying zone for silver is between 83,500 and 84,000, with intraday resistance levels at 86,450 and 87,100.



**CRUDE OIL**

__Intra day bias: Upward momentum. 
Support levels: 6400 & 6300.
Resistance levels: 6600 and 6730.__

The ideal low-risk buying zone was around the 6000/6050 area, where we initially recommended a positional buy trade with a stop loss below 5980. Since then, prices have surged rapidly, currently hovering near 6500. Although momentum remains upward, the risk-reward ratio has deteriorated for long positions. While it's possible to continue buying on dips, there are no clear levels to set a meaningful stop loss. Intraday support is at 6400 and 6300, with resistance expected near 6600.



**NATURAL GAS**

__Intra day bias: Downward
Support levels: 159 & 154.
Resistance levels: 170 and 177.__

The downtrend is likely to persist today, driven by forecasts of moderate weather in the coming weeks across the US, which could reduce natural gas demand. Additionally, elevated stock levels may continue to pressure prices. Resistance levels are at 170 and 177, with support around 159/160.



**COPPER**

__Intra day bias: Bullish
Support levels: 807 & 790
Resistance levels: 833 & 843__

Shanghai Futures Exchange inventory data indicates a seventh consecutive decline in copper stocks, fueling traders' optimism for a continued price rebound. The intraday bias remains upward, and we recommend buying on dips. Key resistance is around 832/833, with support zones at 807 and 790. The overall trend remains bullish as long as prices stay above 790.



**ZINC**

__Intra day bias: Corrective within a broad uptrend
Support levels: 264 & 260
Resistance levels: 275 & 280__

The easy gains have already been realized, with prices surging from 240 to 270. As they approach the key resistance zone of 275/277, caution is advised for those holding long positions. For traders considering short positions‚Äîthough risky against the strong uptrend‚Äîit's crucial to set stops above 280. Support is likely around 264 and 260.



**ALUMINIUM**

__Intra day bias: Upward momentum
Support levels: 227 & 223
Resistance levels: 237 & 240__

The easy gains have already been captured, with prices climbing from 206 to 237, driven by a significant drop in aluminum inventory. While the intraday bias remains upward, we may see consolidation and sideways movement in aluminum over the next few trading sessions. Support is expected around 227 and 223, with resistance near 237 and 240.

Resistance levels: 6520 and 6560.__

Our warning yesterday regarding fresh long positions was well-timed, with prices pulling back by 170 rupees from recent highs and currently hovering near 6350 levels. While OPEC+ production cuts have placed a floor under prices, they have not been sufficient to drive oil higher.

Demand concerns persist, as China's demand growth outlook has been downgraded, and U.S. refinery margins are near a 3.5-year low. Efficiency gains in U.S. shale production have also exceeded expectations, with output rising by 200,000 barrels per day above forecast levels. OPEC+ may respond by strategically adding supply to discipline non-OPEC producers, especially if they seek to curb U.S. shale growth more aggressively.

Given these factors, prices could undershoot in the short term, particularly if OPEC+ takes stronger measures to suppress shale expansion. Demand growth over the current and upcoming quarter remains a key focus. If demand does not pick up, the risk of prices breaking below the current range will increase.

We anticipate range-bound trading, with the upper end of the range capped at 6800 and the lower end near 6000. The downside risk to oil prices is rising, especially in the absence of any major geopolitical disruptions from West Asia. This could unfold over the next few months, but for now, we maintain a range-bound outlook, favoring active option sellers.

For the day, although no strong support levels are evident, technical zones around 6320 and the 6200-6230 range may provide interim support. Resistance is seen near 6520, with the next level at 6560.

__Intra day bias: Downward

The downtrend in natural gas prices is expected to continue today, driven by forecasts of moderate weather across the U.S. in the coming weeks, which could reduce demand. Elevated stock levels are also likely to keep prices under pressure. Key resistance levels are at 185 and 192, while support is anticipated around 168 and 155.

The longevity of this optimism remains uncertain, but as long as it persists, a chart-based approach is advisable. With the intraday bias still upward, buying on dips is recommended.

__Intra day bias: Upward

Copper inventory levels are rising once again on the LME, but the real concern for copper bulls is the widening contango, where far-month futures are trading at a premium to near-month contracts. A wide contango environment enables speculative bears and producers to engage in cash-and-carry strategies, which can put downward pressure on prices. The current spread of nearly 8 rupees between the first two months is notably elevated. 

However, price action in LME and Comex copper futures is showing some bullish signs, suggesting that domestic copper prices may not see significant declines. For the day, it is crucial to monitor the LME inventory release in the afternoon. A key support level to watch on the downside is 790. Traders looking to go long on copper should consider placing a stop-loss below 790.

Over the past couple of weeks, zinc prices have been bolstered by news of production cuts from Chinese smelters due to low refining charges. As prices approach the critical resistance zone of 275-277, caution is advised for those holding long positions. While the prevailing trend remains strong, traders considering short positions should be mindful of the risks and set stops above 280. On the downside, support is anticipated around the 264 and 260 levels.

Aluminium prices continue to find support from declining inventory levels on the LME, making it crucial for traders to monitor daily inventory data closely. We have been anticipating a period of consolidation and correction in Aluminium prices, and this trend appears to be unfolding. Key support is seen around the 223 level, with further support in the 216-218 region. The intraday bias remains neutral, suggesting a cautious approach in the near term.

__Intra day bias: Consolidation within a broad uptrend.
Support levels: 71,700 & 70,800
Resistance levels: 72,320 and 73,000__

Regional US Fed Governor Raphael Bostic remains unconvinced that a rate cut in September is a certainty, but the market largely dismissed his comments. In recent trading sessions, the US Dollar Index has seen a corrective rise, driven by the firming of US Treasury yields. This uptick in the dollar has contributed to consolidation in gold prices, aligning with our previous expectations. We have been anticipating consolidation in the metal, and this trend appears to be unfolding. The positional bias remains upward; hence, buying on dips is advisable as long as prices stay above the 70,800 level on MCX futures.

__Intra day bias: Consolidation within a broad uptrend.
Support levels: 83,300 & 81,700
Resistance levels: 86,200 and 86,600__

Silver is often influenced by the movements in both gold and copper, given its dual role as a precious metal and an industrial commodity. The growing demand from green energy sectors and the electric vehicle industry has further increased silver's industrial usage. As a result, silver tends to perform well when both gold and copper are on the rise. Notably, it often outperforms gold when the broader base metals complex is trending upwards, and underperforms when the complex weakens. This makes silver a more dynamic ""risk-on"" and ""risk-off"" asset compared to gold.

Over the past two trading sessions, silver has been consolidating, reflecting the pullback in both copper and gold prices. However, the positional bias remains upward. The intraday bias also remains bullish as long as prices hold above the 83,300-support level.



3Ô∏è‚É£ **CRUDE OIL**

__Intra day bias: Downward.
Support levels: 6200 & 6050.
Resistance levels: 6400 and 6560.__

The ongoing tug-of-war between demand pessimism and supply disruptions is likely to keep oil prices rangebound for now. The situation in Libya is reportedly deteriorating, with the 200,000 bpd Sarir field potentially shutting down following disruptions at the El Feel, Amal, Nafoora, and Abu Attifel systems. Libya, which exports around one million barrels of oil per day, is a key swing producer. If its entire supply goes offline due to political unrest, it could provide some support to prices by partially offsetting the narrative of a supply glut driven by weak demand. Meanwhile, OPEC is set to make a final decision on upcoming production hikes in the next quarter.

For the day, while no strong support levels are evident, technical zones around the 6,200 range may offer interim support. Resistance is seen near 6,400, with a subsequent level at 6,560. If prices break below 6,200, a more substantial support region near 6,000 could come into play. For intraday trading, short positions could be considered as long as prices remain below the 6,400 resistance level.

September natural gas prices rebounded from a four-month low in the nearest-futures contract and closed higher yesterday, driven by short covering. This recovery was prompted by updated forecasts from Atmospheric G2, which indicated a significant warming trend across a large portion of the US from September 2-6. Such weather conditions are expected to increase natural gas demand from electricity providers for air conditioning needs. Consequently, MCX natural gas prices could see further upside due to continued short covering, with the potential to test the 189/190 levels on September futures.",telegram,neutral,0.7213858962059021,0.0007310298252105607,0.0007310298252105607,-0.66969794,0.1779,1.0,1.0,0,0

__Intra day bias: Consolidation within a broad uptrend.
Support levels: 71,750 & 71,000
Resistance levels: 72,300 and 73,000__

The second release of the US 2Q24 GDP figures, which isn't typically a major market mover, offered a little something for everyone. Quarterly GDP growth for 2Q was revised upwards from 2.8% to 3.0% , mainly due to a notable increase in the growth rate of personal consumption, which rose from 2.3% to 2.8%. This stronger-than-expected GDP data pushed US Treasury yields higher, causing the yield curve to bear steepen. 

A bear steepening of the curve tends to be supportive of the US Dollar, and in response, the US Dollar Index rebounded. Since early 2023, the US Dollar Index has found support in the 100-101 zone five times. As long as this support zone holds, the risk of a pullback in gold prices increases. Unlike the early part of the year, when price-insensitive buyers like central banks drove demand, the current push higher in gold is driven by speculative demand, which is more sensitive to trends in the US Dollar and bond yields. 

Today, it‚Äôs crucial to monitor spot gold prices in dollar terms. There is a possibility of a pullback towards the $2,470/$2,480 region before a potential rebound. If there is a corresponding drop in MCX gold prices, we could see them test the key trendline support at the 71,000/71,100 region, where fresh buying opportunities may emerge. Immediate support is around 71,750.



**2Ô∏è‚É£ SILVER**

__Intra day bias: Upward as long as it holds USD 29 level
Support levels: 86,200 & 85,700
Resistance levels: 87,750 and 88,850__

With both copper and gold prices holding firm, silver lacks a clear reason to decline. However, recent price action suggests that buyers are not strong enough to drive prices higher, leading to a period of consolidation. A key level to watch is $29.00 on the spot market. Similarly, for MCX December futures, a critical support zone is around ‚Çπ85,700.

Buying on dips can be considered as long as these levels hold. However, if silver breaks below these support zones ‚Äî particularly below $29.00 ‚Äî the risk of a deeper decline increases. Should this scenario unfold, we will keep you updated.



**3Ô∏è‚É£ CRUDE OIL**

__Intra day bias: Upward
Support levels: 6320 & 6200
Resistance levels: 6500 and 6560.
__

The timely positional trade note on crude worked well yesterday, with prices surging from 6,250 to 6,450 levels. Several factors are currently supporting crude prices. Political unrest in Libya may potentially take nearly the entire export of 1 million barrels per day offline. Additionally, Iraq is planning to cut oil output from 4.25 million barrels per day (bpd) in July to around 3.9 million bpd in September, just below its OPEC quota of 4 million bpd. The reduction in Libyan crude oil production, the rising threat of a wider conflict in the Middle East, and EIA crude oil storage levels at an eight-month low are all creating tailwinds for crude oil prices. 

However, we should not get carried away with expectations of a price spiral, as demand concerns in China and the risk of OPEC+ adding 0.5 million bpd to supply could cap prices near $82/$84 levels on WTI and ‚Çπ6,900/‚Çπ7,000 on MCX futures. For the day, we are inclined towards an upside bias; therefore, a ""buy on decline"" strategy is recommended, with a stop loss below ‚Çπ6,200 levels. The strong support at the ‚Çπ6,200 strike, indicated by substantial put writing, reinforces this view. 

Call spreads or range-forward trades are also viable. For example, a range-forward strategy of selling the ‚Çπ6,200 put at ‚Çπ90 and using the proceeds to buy a ‚Çπ6,600 call at ‚Çπ87 results in a net credit of ‚Çπ3.

2024-08-30,"4Ô∏è‚É£ **NATURAL GAS**

__Intra day bias: Upward
Support levels: 174 & 169
Resistance levels: 190 and 192__

Yesterday's session was a rollercoaster for natural gas traders. On the MCX, prices fell sharply from 180 to 171 before staging a strong rebound to close at the 180 level. The 169-171 zone has now established itself as a strong support, with prices bouncing from this area three times.

Long traders can consider a ""buy on dips"" strategy as long as the market respects this support, with a stop loss set below 168.00 and targets at 190-192.00 levels.



**5Ô∏è‚É£ COPPER**


__Intra day bias: Upward
Support levels: 807 & 790
Resistance levels: 833 & 843__

The current price structure of copper does not inspire much confidence, indicating a challenging trading environment filled with potential whipsaws. It's important to monitor the daily inventory releases from the LME in the afternoon; if inventories continue to build, prices may trend downward. For now, we anticipate a range-bound movement between 790 and 816/820 on September futures.



**6Ô∏è‚É£ ZINC**

__Intra day bias: Upward drift
Support levels: 264 & 260
Resistance levels: 275 & 280__

In recent weeks, zinc prices have been supported by news of production cuts from Chinese smelters due to low refining charges. As prices near the critical resistance zone of 275-277, long position holders should exercise caution. While the overall trend remains strong, traders looking to enter short positions should be aware of the risks and place stops above 280. On the downside, support is expected around the 264 and 260 levels.



7Ô∏è‚É£ **ALUMINIUM**

__Intra day bias: Sideways
Support levels: 223 & 218
Resistance levels: 237 & 240__

Aluminium prices are finding support from declining inventory levels on the LME, making it important for traders to keep a close eye on daily inventory data. But at the same time, aluminium inventory in China has ticked higher. That‚Äôs why we've been expecting a phase of consolidation and correction in aluminium prices, and this seems to be taking shape. Key support is around the 223 level, with additional support in the 216-218 range. The intraday bias remains neutral, suggesting a cautious approach in the near term.",telegram,neutral,0.6178686022758484,0.05433057399749758,0.05433057399749758,-0.27425885,0.9573,0.0,1.0,0,0

2024-08-30,"US inflation numbers largely met estimates, indicating moderating inflation and reinforcing expectations for a September rate cut. 

However, this did not lead to an uptick in commodities as the data did not alter the Fed‚Äôs anticipated easing path‚Äîa 25 basis point rate cut at the next FOMC meeting. The reduced likelihood of a more aggressive easing, given resilient consumer spending and stronger-than-expected GDP growth, led to a stronger dollar, which rose to 101.6, while COMEX Gold futures slipped below $2550/oz.

US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.2% month-over-month and was up 2.5% year-over-year in July, both in line with estimates.

Core PCE rose 0.2% mom in line with estimates while yoy was slightly lower at 2.6% compared to Bloomberg estimate of 2.7%.

Also, personal income increased 0.3%, slightly higher than the 0.2% estimate, while consumer spending rose 0.5%, in line with the forecast.

__Intra day bias: Upward drift
Support levels: 6150 & 6000
Resistance levels: 6385 and 6510__

In August, Asia is estimated to have imported 26.74 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, an increase of 2.18 million bpd from July's two-year low, according to data from LSEG Oil Research. This rebound follows a sharp decline in July, which marked the lowest daily import level since July 2022. The increase in Asia's crude imports can be partly attributed to seasonal demand, as importers typically ramp up purchases in the third quarter to build fuel inventories ahead of peak winter consumption. Additionally, the recovery may be driven by lower oil prices.

Looking ahead, it remains uncertain whether this momentum will continue, given the soft economic data coming out of China and the lackluster performance of other industrial commodities. Chinese refiners also remain cautious, which could limit further gains in crude imports.

On the geopolitical front, there are signs of progress in resolving the Libyan oil crisis. The United Nations Support Mission in Libya announced that it held talks on Monday to mediate between the two rival factions, achieving ""significant understandings"" on ways to address the ongoing banking crisis, though further details were not disclosed. Traders are closely monitoring developments in Libya, as these could impact the oil market.

Oil prices on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) have been trading within a narrowing range. The major support zone is currently near the 6,000 level, with key resistance between 6,500 and 6,520. Traders may consider buying on dips, with a positional stop below 5,980. For those with a lower risk appetite, options strategies such as call spreads may be suitable. Alternatively, a seagull strategy‚Äîselling an out-of-the-money put option to finance a call spread‚Äîcould be employed to manage risk.




**4Ô∏è‚É£ NATURAL GAS**
__
Intra day bias: Range bound
Support levels: 181 & 177
Resistance levels: 190 and 192__

Natural gas markets appear somewhat stretched, but it's important to note that yesterday was Labor Day in the United States and Canada, meaning a significant portion of traders were absent from the market. The current rising trendline under the prices seems quite steep, raising doubts about its ability to hold for an extended period. Generally, the steeper a well-defined trendline, the lower its probability of maintaining support or resistance, as prices can simply move sideways and break through.

For intraday traders, it may be prudent to wait for fresh cues before entering a position. On the MCX September futures, support is around the 181 and 177 levels, while resistance is seen near the 190 and 192 levels.




**5Ô∏è‚É£ COPPER**

__Intra day bias: Downward drift
Support levels: 790 & 780
Resistance levels: 805 & 812__

In our analysis yesterday, we noted that copper prices appeared weak on the charts, suggesting a further downside. Prices continue to follow the path of least resistance, which remains downward. As long as prices remain below the 812 zone, positional traders may consider selling on any rise. The key support area is around 790, with further support in the 780-782 region.

2024-09-04,"On November 27, 2014, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) gathered in Vienna, Austria, for one of its regular meetings. The outcome of this one would prove momentous. Although Brent crude had traded comfortably above $100 a barrel for most of the prior few years, a booming US shale sector had caused prices to dip to the high $70s as attendees arrived. Led by Saudi Arabia, OPEC made the fateful decision to engage in a price war with American producers, a move that shocked market observers: 

‚ÄúThe stated belief from some OPEC members at that time was that this would cause a dip in oil prices, and that would put a lot of the marginal shale oil producers out of business. Instead, oil prices plummeted, some shale oil producers went out of business, but the strategy indeed cost OPEC at least a trillion dollars of lost revenue as most shale producers held on.

In late 2016 the cartel waved the white flag, abandoning this strategy and returning to making production cuts to boost prices. That strategy persists to this day.‚Äù

OPEC grossly underestimated both the willingness and the capacity of US shale companies to incinerate shareholder capital in the name of growth. Even as oil prices ground lower‚Äîeventually bottoming out in the upper-$20s in January of 2016, well below the estimated marginal cost of production for most shale upstarts‚ÄîUS production climbed inexorably higher. The few companies that did file for bankruptcy either kept producing or sold assets to others that could, using the courts as a shield to recapitalize in the hopes of exploiting firmer prices in the future.

__**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **GOLD**

__Intra day bias: Consolidation within a broad uptrend.
Support levels: 70,850 & 70,000
Resistance levels: 71,650 and 72,300__

Overnight, the US released its JOLTS data, along with factory and durable goods orders. The market interpreted the JOLTS report as weak, with job openings falling by 237,000 to their lowest level since January 2021. Factory and durable goods orders were broadly in line with expectations, showing a 5.0% month-over-month growth in factory orders and a 9.8% uptick in durable goods orders, driven largely by transportation orders. Following the release, US bond yields fell, and the US Dollar Index ticked lower, which supported a rebound in gold prices from the $2,470 level.

In the bullion market, gold priced in dollars is showing strong support around $2,470. Positional traders are advised to consider buying on dips, with a stop-loss placed at $2,460 on a spot reference basis. For traders on the MCX, if there is a corresponding move, a stop-loss should be set below ‚Çπ70,850. Incase, gold MCX breaks 70,850, then one can reverse to short position.

This strategy reflects a cautious approach, given the potential market volatility driven by this week‚Äôs upcoming US Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) and ISM data releases.



2Ô∏è‚É£ **SILVER**

__Intra day bias: Near a support level
Support levels: 83,000 & 82,000
Resistance levels: 84,500 and 85,200__

Silver in the spot market (dollars) remains weak, with its price caught between conflicting signals. Gold has been unable to break out of its consolidation range, while base metals continue to drift lower. Silver has strong support near the $27.60 level in dollar terms, which translates to around ‚Çπ82,000 on MCX futures, assuming a like-for-like move. If this support level fails to hold, silver could experience a deeper decline, potentially towards the $26.70 level, which corresponds to approximately ‚Çπ79,500 on MCX futures.

The support levels around $26.70 and ‚Çπ82,000 are considered strong, so traders may look to buy on dips but with a ""stop and reverse"" strategy below the $27.50 mark on the spot market. If silver falls below $27.50, it would be prudent to reverse from long to short positions with appropriate stop losses. Resistance is expected near the $28.75‚Äì$28.80 range in dollar terms, or around ‚Çπ85,000‚Äì‚Çπ85,200 on MCX futures.

This strategy aims to balance the potential for upside gains with caution against further downside risks, given the current market conditions.




**3Ô∏è‚É£ CRUDE OIL**

__Intra day bias: Downward
Support levels: 5800 & 5700
Resistance levels: 5930 and 6020__

OPEC+ is reportedly considering delaying an oil output increase scheduled for October, following oil prices dropping to their lowest in nine months. However, this has not halted the decline in prices, with WTI crude hovering just below $69 per barrel and MCX futures trading near the ‚Çπ5,800 level. Global demand growth has been lackluster this year, estimated at around a million barrels per day or less, while rising inventories‚Äîparticularly in floating storage‚Äîsuggest that actual supply may be higher than officially indicated. Meanwhile, non-OPEC+ producers continue to ramp up output, and natural gas liquids and biofuels are meeting more than half of the demand growth, putting OPEC+ in a challenging position.

Crude oil remains a complex commodity to trade due to the multitude of factors influencing its price, from geo-economics to geopolitics. The current trend is downward, though the market appears oversold. If the strong downward momentum continues, prices could decline further toward the $67 level, or around ‚Çπ5,700 on MCX, where the next significant support level lies. Key resistance is located in the ‚Çπ6,010‚Äì‚Çπ6,030 zone, and as long as crude remains below this range, the bias will stay downward.",telegram,negative,0.9696583151817322,-0.17065211687594653,-0.17065211687594653,0.0050157662,-0.8658,0.0,1.0,0,1
2024-09-05,"**4Ô∏è‚É£ NATURAL GAS**

__Intra day bias: Range bound
Support levels: 177 & 172
Resistance levels: 190 and 192__

Yesterday, gas prices reversed sharply from the ‚Çπ192 level to ‚Çπ179, as traders continue to navigate the established range between ‚Çπ160 and ‚Çπ192, with interim support around the ‚Çπ175‚Äì‚Çπ176 zone. Current market conditions and ground reports do not provide a strong enough catalyst for a significant short squeeze. However, the expectation of further production cutbacks may help maintain a price floor near ‚Çπ160.

On the upside, resistance remains firm at the ‚Çπ192 level, with a further barrier at ‚Çπ202. Traders should watch these key levels closely, as they may define the next directional move in the market.



**5Ô∏è‚É£ COPPER**

__Intra day bias: Oversold
Support levels: 778 & 768
Resistance levels: 790 & 795__

Copper prices appear oversold but remain weak, suggesting the potential for a range to develop between ‚Çπ778 and ‚Çπ795 on MCX futures over the next few days. Traders looking to take contrarian long positions should place stop-losses below ‚Çπ778 for intraday trades. If prices break below ‚Çπ778 and sustain, a further decline towards the ‚Çπ765‚Äì‚Çπ768 levels is possible. 

This strategy offers an opportunity to capitalize on short-term price movements while managing risk in a potentially volatile market.



**6Ô∏è‚É£ ZINC**

__Intra day bias: Downward drift
Support levels: 253 & 247
Resistance levels: 267 & 272__

This week, we have adopted a bearish stance on zinc prices following a breakdown from a double top formation observed on the intraday chart. The next significant support level is anticipated around 253-254. Key resistance levels are identified at 267 and 272. Positional traders might consider initiating sell positions on any upward movement, with a stop-loss set above 266 to manage risk effectively.



**7Ô∏è‚É£ ALUMINIUM**

__Intra day bias: Oversold
Support levels: 218 & 215

Our bearish outlook on aluminium has proven accurate, with prices currently testing support around the 218 level. For today, aluminium shows decent support near 218.

# The US cotton crop is in good shape, while the market is evaluating future demand.

# Falling crude oil prices, driven by demand concerns and mixed signals from oil producers, put pressure on cotton futures due to reduced polyester prices.

# US Soybean futures prices retreated slightly on Thursday but remained near multi-week highs.

# A weaker US dollar and firmer market sentiment contributed to the price increase.

# In Brazil,the area planted with soybeans is expected to expand at its slowest pace in nearly two decades due to low prices.

# Palm oil prices were supported by a potential delay in increased supply and stronger crude oil futures.

2024-09-05,"**Gold ETF Update: World Gold Council**

**In August, global gold ETFs experienced continued growth, with inflows of US$2.1 billion, marking the fourth consecutive month of positive performance. **

This trend was driven by strong demand across all regions, with North American funds contributing the largest share, adding US$1.4 billion, followed by European funds, which gained US$362 million. 

The sustained demand for gold, coupled with these inflows, has driven a significant increase in global assets under management (AUM) for gold ETFs, which have surged by 20% year-to-date. 

By the end of August, the total AUM reached a new record of US$257 billion. The strength in gold prices has been a key factor behind these inflows, as investors continue to seek safe-haven assets amidst global economic uncertainties. 

The persistent demand for gold ETFs reflects investor confidence in the asset as a hedge against inflation and currency volatility.

**

**__"" Amateurs focus on how much they can make. Professionals focus on how much they could lose""__**


1Ô∏è‚É£ **GOLD**

__Intra-day bias: Consolidating for a bullish breakout
Support levels: 70,850 & 70,000
Resistance levels: 72,300 and 73,800__

The ADP National Employment Report revealed that private payrolls increased by only 99,000 jobs last month, the smallest gain since January 2021, after a downward revision to 111,000 in July. This weaker jobs data led to a decline in U.S. yields and a drop in the U.S. Dollar Index. The U.S. yield curve continues to steepen, with the 10-year and 2-year yields almost at parity. Today, the focus will be on the U.S. Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report, which is set to be released this evening.

Over the past three weeks, gold has been consolidating above its breakout level of $2,470 per ounce in the spot market. As long as gold remains above this level, we would adopt a ""buy on dip"" strategy in the MCX market, with a stop-loss based on a spot reference of $2,460. If gold breaks above $2,540 and sustains, prices could advance toward $2,600 on the spot market.

On the MCX, we suggest buying on declines with a positional stop loss below ‚Çπ70,800. Strong resistance is around ‚Çπ72,300, and a clear breakout above this level could see gold aiming for ‚Çπ73,800 to ‚Çπ74,000.


2Ô∏è‚É£ **SILVER**

__Intra day bias: Bullish breakout as expected
Support levels: 84,400 & 83,500
Resistance levels: 86,800 and 87,200__

Our contrarian positional view in silver worked out well yesterday, as silver bounced as expected from the $27.50 level to around $28.80 in spot dollar terms. During the Asian session today, silver is testing a polarity level, where the previous trendline resistance has now turned into support, near the $28.50-$28.60 per ounce range. Given this setup, we would be inclined to buy on dips with a stop-loss below $28.10 on a spot basis. Silver could then target the $29.30 and $29.70 levels.

In MCX terms, the strategy remains to buy on dips with a stop-loss below ‚Çπ83,500, aiming for targets of ‚Çπ86,800 and ‚Çπ87,200.


3Ô∏è‚É£ **CRUDE OIL**

__Intra day bias: Possibility of a counter trend up move
Support levels: 5800 & 5700
Resistance levels: 5930 and 6020__

With U.S. yields softening ahead of the key jobs data, the U.S. Dollar Index is trending lower, which is supporting higher commodity prices. An oversold reading on short-term momentum for crude oil is also noteworthy. Therefore, I am not comfortable taking a positional short in crude oil at the current levels of $69.24 on NYMEX and ‚Çπ5,834 on MCX, as there is a risk of a short squeeze toward the ‚Çπ5,950-‚Çπ6,000 range. At that point, we could consider fresh short positions, depending on the order flow.

However, traders looking to take a contrarian long position are advised to avoid futures and instead focus on low-risk call spreads. The strategy is straightforward: when trading in the direction of the trend, using futures is appropriate, but when taking a contrarian stance, it is advisable to use option spreads.




**4Ô∏è‚É£ COPPER**

__Intra day bias: Counter trend rebound
Support levels: 778 & 768
Resistance levels: 795 & 803__

Copper prices are rebounding from the support region around 778. As long as prices hold above this level, they could target the 800 and 803 levels. In the near term, we expect copper to trade within a range of 778 to 803. We recommend buying on dips, with a stop-loss set below 778.



**5Ô∏è‚É£ NATURAL GAS**

__Intra day bias: Upward bias
Support levels: 178 & 182
Resistance levels: 192 and 202__

As long as natural gas remains above the 178 level, there is potential for it to reach 200/202. Positional traders are advised to buy on dips with a stop-loss set below 178.



**6Ô∏è‚É£ ZINC**

__Intra day bias: At support
Support levels: 253 & 247
Resistance levels: 264 & 272__

Zinc has demonstrated strong support around the 253 level, suggesting a potential rebound towards the 262/264 range. However, if the 253 support level is breached and prices remain below it, we could see a decline towards the 247 and 244 levels.",telegram,neutral,0.8921442031860352,0.09836516312122345,0.09836516312122345,-0.076589674,0.6833,0.0,1.0,0,0

2024-09-06,"*US data update*

The latest Bureau of Labor Statistics data reveals that U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 142,000 last month, bringing the three-month average to its lowest level since mid-2020. The unemployment rate decreased to 4.2%, marking its first decline in five months.

Average hourly earnings rose by 0.4% on a monthly basis and 3.8% year-over-year, surpassing estimates of 0.3% and 3.7%, respectively.

While the hiring numbers fell short of forecasts for August and previous months were revised downward, suggesting a potential slowdown in the labor market, the drop in the unemployment rate and higher wage growth indicate a soft landing. As a result, this data alone may not prompt the Fed to implement a 50 basis point rate cut. Consequently, the dollar rebounded sharply from a session low of 100.58 to 101.39, while gold prices declined from $2,559 per ounce to below $2,540 per ounce.

Attention now shifts to next week‚Äôs Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, as persistent inflation could further impact the likelihood of a 50 basis point rate cut.

2024-09-06,"The US non-farm payrolls (NFP) report for August came in line with expectations, but the market's reaction was far from muted. 


Traders, seemingly anticipating a worse-than-expected outcome, had built up a significant bearish position.


 However, the relatively benign data triggered a sharp reversal, sending equities, currencies, and commodities tumbling.



The US dollar strengthened markedly, buoyed by rising US Treasury yields. This, in turn, weighed heavily on oil and gold prices.



 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies (OPEC+) appear to have lost their pricing power, becoming price takers rather than setters.


 A perfect storm is brewing in the oil market , with weak demand, surging inventory, rising NGLs and biofuel output and rising non OPEC production. Add to that, today's post NFP dollar strength.

2024-09-10,"Oil Crash: A Boon for India

( Anindya Banerjee)


 The global oil market is experiencing a seismic shift, with Brent crude prices plunging to 22-month lows. This dramatic decline is a double-edged sword for nations around the world, but for net oil consumers like India, it's a much-needed windfall.


Lower oil prices directly translate into reduced inflation, effectively acting as a tax cut for Indian households. With more money in their pockets, consumers are likely to increase their spending, boosting demand for goods and services across various sectors.


This increased consumer activity will benefit businesses, particularly those that are not directly involved in the oil industry, as they will experience higher sales and improved operating margins.



The Indian government also stands to gain from this oil price slump. By strategically managing the pass-through of lower prices to consumers, the government can potentially increase its fiscal space, allowing for increased public spending or debt reduction.


 The extent to which these funds are utilized will determine the immediate economic impact on households and businesses.
While the declining oil prices are generally positive for the Indian economy, their impact on the rupee is less predictable. 


The lack of speculative activity and arbitrage in the Indian currency market has limited its responsiveness to global economic developments. 


As a result, predicting the exact movement of the rupee based solely on oil prices is a challenging task.",telegram,positive,0.5914109945297241,0.1325391940975189,0.1325391940975189,-0.5424016,0.5187,1.0,1.0,0,0

**

**__
""Trading is like a dance with risk‚Äîmaster the rhythm, and you‚Äôll lead the way""__**


1Ô∏è‚É£ **GOLD**

__Intra-day bias: Consolidating for a bullish breakout
Support levels: 71,150 & 70,850
Resistance levels: 72,300 and 73,800
__
The upcoming US CPI inflation data will be a crucial factor to monitor. Consensus forecasts project a 0.2% month-on-month (MoM) increase, which is expected to bring the annual inflation rate down from 2.9% to 2.5% year-on-year (YoY).

With a bullish positional outlook on gold intact, the current consolidation between USD 2470 and USD 2530 on the spot market, and ‚Çπ70,800 to ‚Çπ72,300 on MCX futures, presents an excellent opportunity to accumulate fresh long positions. However, it's essential to maintain a stop-loss below the USD 2460 level on a spot basis for positional longs.

Should prices break above the USD 2530/40 zone, we could see a potential rally toward the USD 2600 mark and around ‚Çπ74,000 on MCX futures.



2Ô∏è‚É£ **SILVER
**
__Intra day bias: Expect it to move higher
Support levels: 82,600 & 82,000
Resistance levels: 84,950 and 86,000__

Gold continues to outperform silver as the ongoing economic malaise in China weighs on industrial demand for silver. The broader weakness in base metals is also contributing to silver‚Äôs underperformance. The gold-silver ratio has climbed to around 89, and it has peaked in the 91-92 range multiple times over the past 18 months. This suggests there is still room for gold to outperform before silver starts catching up.

At the same time, copper prices have been consolidating above 778 for the past few sessions. If copper breaks higher instead of pulling back, silver prices could get a boost as industrial demand strengthens.

Currently, silver is trading in a range between $27.60 and $29.20 in spot terms, and ‚Çπ82,000 to ‚Çπ86,000 on MCX. With the US dollar correcting and turning lower and US yields drifting down, we are inclined to buy silver on dips, with a stop-and-reverse strategy below ‚Çπ82,000 in MCX terms. Further positions can be added once silver breaks above $29.30 in spot dollar terms.




**3Ô∏è‚É£ CRUDE OIL**

__Intra day bias: Oversold but strong downtrend
Support levels: 5500 & 5350
Resistance levels: 5650 and 5800__

Once MCX crude oil broke below the ‚Çπ6,000 level, we flagged the risk of a significant breakdown in oil prices, emerging from a multi-year consolidation. Yesterday, we saw both WTI and Brent crude prices plunge to their lowest levels in 2-3 years. The sell-off reflects growing concerns over weakening global demand, particularly driven by China. Official data released on Tuesday showed that China's August crude imports were down 7% year-over-year, continuing the downward trend seen throughout 2024.

Further weighing on the market, both OPEC and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) revised down their forecasts for Chinese oil demand growth in their latest monthly reports. OPEC still expects Chinese demand to increase by nearly 560,000 b/d this year, while the EIA offers a more bearish estimate of just 100,000 b/d. Hedge funds have also turned net bearish on crude oil, contributing to the negative sentiment.

The backwardation in the forward curve for both Brent and WTI has flattened recently, as the front-month premium to later-dated contracts has shrunk. Since backwardated structures typically signal a tight market, this suggests a gradual loosening of supply-demand balances. The seven-month Brent spread has narrowed from $4.31/bbl in mid-July to around $1.31/bbl in early September.

Meanwhile, U.S. Gulf Coast hurricane Francine is not expected to significantly disrupt supply, as it is forecasted to avoid Texas and make landfall in Louisiana on Wednesday.

In the near term, while oil appears oversold, we could see some consolidation between ‚Çπ5,500 and ‚Çπ5,750 this week. However, the broader price direction remains downward, with potential for prices to reach ‚Çπ5,000 over the coming weeks. Major resistance levels are at ‚Çπ5,800 and ‚Çπ6,000.",telegram,positive,0.8957735896110535,0.45151407660245896,0.45151407660245896,-0.031371847,0.836,1.0,1.0,1,0
2024-09-11,"**4Ô∏è‚É£ NATURAL GAS**

__Intra-day bias: Range bound
Support levels: 176 & 170
Resistance levels: 192 and 202__

Natural gas continues to oscillate within a broad range between 170 and 202. There is strong interim support around the 176/178 levels, with interim resistance near 192/194. The impact of the Gulf Coast hurricane is expected to be minimal on LNG terminal operations, limiting any significant bearish pressure on prices. Given this setup, traders could consider buying on dips near 178, with a stop loss placed just below 175.

Additionally, we expect option-implied volatility to decline, which could negatively affect option premiums. Current implied volatility is around 65% for at-the-money forward (ATMF) options, and we could see this drift lower to around 58-60% if natural gas remains rangebound for an extended period.



**5Ô∏è‚É£ COPPER**

__Intra day bias: Consolidation underway
Support levels: 782 & 768
Resistance levels: 794 & 803__

Copper prices are consolidating within a tightening, triangular pattern, indicating an impending breakout or breakdown. A decisive breakout above 794 would be a signal to initiate long positions, with a stop loss below 787 and an upside target of 800/803. Conversely, if prices break down below 782, it would present a shorting opportunity, with a stop loss above 788 and a downside target of 766/768.



**6Ô∏è‚É£ ZINC**

__Intra-day bias: Bullish breakout
Support levels: 253 & 247
Resistance levels: 260 & 264__

Zinc is breaking out of a downward sloping trend, offering a potential long opportunity. Traders can consider entering long positions with a stop loss below 252, as the price is currently around 255.50. The first target is 260, followed by a secondary target at 264.



**7Ô∏è‚É£ ALUMINIUM**
__
Intra day bias: Consolidation
Support levels: 217 & 215
Resistance levels: 222 & 227__

Aluminum is currently trading within a range of 217 to 222. A breakout above 222 would signal a long opportunity, with a stop loss below 218, targeting the 227/230 region. However, if the price drops below 217, the downtrend is likely to resume, with downside targets of 215 and potentially 210.",telegram,negative,0.8512046337127686,-0.23236494396209717,-0.23236494396209717,-0.7897699,0.8126,0.0,1.0,0,1

# ICE Cotton trading positive for the 2nd consecutive session today concerns about potential damage to US cotton crops due to tropical storm Francine. A significant decline in crop ratings also supported the rise in cotton prices, although gains were limited by weaker crude oil prices.

# On the weather front, Tropical Storm Francine is particularly threatening Louisiana and Arkansas, key cotton-producing states. The US National Hurricane Center has issued warnings, forecasting that Francine will strengthen into a hurricane and make landfall on the Louisiana coast by September 11.

# US Soybean futures slipped to one-week low (below $10 a bushel) on Tuesday, primarily driven by better-than-expected crop ratings from the USDA. Moreover, the favorable ratings alleviated concerns about recent dry weather and bolstered production prospects.

# The USDA's weekly crop progress report maintained the good-to-excellent rating for the U.S. soybean crop at 65%, defying market expectations for a decline.

# Analysts surveyed by Reuters anticipate the USDA to maintain its U.S. 2024 soybean yield forecast at 53.2 bushels per acre.

# Malaysia Palm oil futures opened higher on Wednesday, despite industry data showing that inventories in Malaysia rose more than expected in August. MPOB reported that palm oil stocks at the end of August increased by 7.34% to 1.88 mt, the highest level in six months.

2024-09-11,"Underlying US inflation unexpectedly picked up in August on higher prices for housing and travel, undercutting the chances of an outsize Federal Reserve interest-rate cut next week.

The so-called core consumer price index ‚Äî which excludes food and energy costs ‚Äî increased 0.3% from July, the most in four months, and 3.2% from a year ago, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showed Wednesday. The three-month annualized rate advanced 2.1%, picking up from 1.6% in July, according to Bloomberg calculations.

Economists see the core gauge as a better indicator of underlying inflation than the overall CPI.

Traders should look for a breakout above $29.20 on the silver spot (USD) to trigger additional momentum. This move could potentially drive silver toward the $30.50-$30.60 range. It's crucial, however, to manage risk by setting a stop loss below the ignition candle, which in this case would be below $28.

A bullish storage report and the impact of the third hurricane to make landfall in the US this year provided strong support to gas futures last week, driving the October contract to a three-week high on Thursday. However, by Friday evening, as Hurricane Francine became old news, the rally lost momentum, with the contract sliding from 202 to 190 on MCX. Unlike Hurricane Beryl in July‚Äîwhich knocked out power to over 2 million customers in the Houston area and reduced gas demand by about 2.5 billion cubic feet per day‚ÄîFrancine had a greater impact on the supply side.

Currently, natural gas inventory is 296 Bcf above the five-year average, or 9.6% higher. The surplus relative to last year has narrowed to 198 Bcf, or 6.2%. The EIA projects storage injections will lag behind the five-year average through the remainder of the refill season, leaving inventories at a 5% surplus to the five-year average by the end of October, down from an 11% surplus at the end of August. The agency also forecasts US gas consumption to average around 90 Bcf/d in 2025, consistent with its projection for this year. However, LNG exports are expected to rise by more than 2 Bcf/d (17%) next year as export capacity expands.

On the supply side, the EIA expects dry gas production to average 103.4 Bcf/d in 2024, climbing by 1.3% to 104.8 Bcf/d in 2025, each up just 0.1% from previous projections.

Given these fundamentals, prices are expected to oscillate within a broad range. A strategy of buying on dips is advisable, with a stop-loss placed below 170.

Hurricane-related disruptions to oil and gas flows from the US Gulf Coast are fading quickly as supplies come back online. This should be bearish for crude, especially with forecasts pointing to a large surplus through the end of next year. However, over the past two trading days, oil has rebounded from its oversold conditions, primarily due to a weaker US dollar ahead of the Fed meeting. Poor economic data from China over the weekend has had little impact on prices, but it remains a macro headwind that oil bulls will need to contend with post-Fed.

It‚Äôs possible that oil prices could continue to rebound in the lead-up to the Fed meeting. However, once the Fed-driven rally in the US Dollar Index and long-term US bonds fades, we may see significant selling pressure return to oil. For now, oil bears could consider taking profits on their short positions and stepping to the sidelines ahead of the event, keeping a close watch on FX and interest rates. Any reversal there could signal an opportunity to re-enter short positions in crude.

Silver is currently displaying a series of sequential chart formations in spot USD terms. Initially, a bullish trendline reversal triggered a double-bottom breakout, which then led to the activation of a cup-and-handle reversal pattern. The overall price targets are in the range of $32.50 to $33.50, depending on your strategy‚Äîconservative, based on the height of the handle, or aggressive, based on the height of the cup.

However, short-term momentum, as reflected by the 10-period RSI, indicates overbought conditions, suggesting the potential for a pullback or consolidation. With the US FOMC meeting approaching on Wednesday, we could see a classic ""buy the rumor, sell the fact"" scenario. This, coupled with overbought technical signals and potential post-event bull fatigue, might lead to a necessary price correction, potentially pulling back toward the $29 area.

This price level could provide a lucrative re-entry opportunity for silver bulls. For a positional trade over the next 3-4 months, a stop-loss should be placed strategically below key support, near $27.50 (the low of the handle), to manage risk effectively.

For intraday traders, the key support zone is around $30, approximately 88,000 INR on MCX. This represents a significant range, which, until mid-last week, was equivalent to an entire day's high and low.

For contrarian traders considering shorts, exercise caution. Shorting in this environment is particularly risky. Rather than using futures, it's advisable to utilize put options to better manage risk.

There was a significant shift in Fed rate cut expectations at the end of last week, sparked by comments from a former Fed Governor, who suggested that a 50-bps cut would have been his preferred option. Additionally, one or two current Fed members have also sounded less cautious about rate cuts recently. As a result, the odds of a 50-bps cut at Wednesday‚Äôs meeting are back up to 60%. This shift has propelled gold prices, which have now broken out of their three-week range between 2470 and 2530, with prices moving towards a test of 2600 USD on spot and 74,000 INR on MCX.

Given that much of the rate cut expectation is already priced in ahead of the Fed meeting, there is potential for a ""buy the rumor, sell the fact"" scenario this week. If this plays out, gold prices may peak post-Fed and correct lower. The peak will likely depend on the trajectory of the US Dollar Index and US interest rates. Historically, this year‚Äôs bullish rallies in gold have ranged between 7%-8% and 10%-13%. If we assume a 7% rally from the recent swing low of 2482, gold could target levels around 2650 USD on spot. Applying a rule of thumb, where a $1 move in spot gold equates to approximately 27 INR in MCX gold futures, this suggests a move towards 75,000/75,300 INR on the MCX main contract.

Silver's traditionally strong positive correlation with gold has weakened significantly, influenced by weak base metal prices.

Recently, silver has been playing catch-up to gold, as observed over the last few trading sessions.

**
2Ô∏è‚É£ Silver and Base Metals Correlation with Equities:**

Both silver and base metals have developed a strong positive correlation with the Nasdaq and overall equity market sentiment.


**3Ô∏è‚É£ Gold‚Äôs Correlation with Currencies:**

__Gold has become:__

Inversely correlated to the US Dollar: This is expected as gold is often seen as a competitor to the dollar in global reserves, acting as an ""anti-dollar.""

__Positively correlated to the Chinese Yuan and Japanese Yen:__

This could be due to the correlation between the Yuan/Yen and the US Dollar Index (DXY). As the DXY has weakened, both the Yuan and Yen have strengthened. There is a hypothesis that a strong Yuan may be boosting private demand for gold in China, as gold becomes more affordable for Chinese buyers (though this remains speculative).


4Ô∏è‚É£ **Crude Oil and Dollar Index Correlation:**

Crude oil has developed a positive correlation with the Dollar Index, which is unusual. Typically, oil prices rise when the dollar weakens, as oil is priced in dollars. The current positive correlation might indicate that the oil market is being driven more by demand-supply fundamentals rather than financial market factors. This suggests that both the dollar and oil markets may be influenced by independent drivers, rather than the usual inverse relationship.

Intraday swings are expected to be volatile, but as long as prices hold above the rising trendline near 184, we remain biased toward an eventual breakout, with the potential to move higher toward the 222/225 levels.

Positional traders can adopt a ""buy on dips"" strategy, with a stop-loss placed just below 180, to capitalize on the expected upward momentum. This setup provides a favorable risk-reward ratio, especially if the breakout materializes as anticipated.**

1Ô∏è‚É£ GOLD
**
__Intra-day bias: Bulls in firm control
Support levels: 72,800 & 72,250
Resistance levels: 74,000 and 74,850__

After a major market-moving event, financial markets tend to settle into a temporary lull, much like the calm following a grand celebration. However, this should not detract from the prevailing bullish outlook in the bullion market, particularly for gold and silver.
 
Historically, gold has performed well when the Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates. While there have been exceptions, the overall theme remains consistent: lower interest rates make the U.S. dollar less attractive and gold more appealing. Gold stands as an alternative to the dollar as a global reserve currency. Unlike the dollar, which can be printed at will, gold is finite‚Äîimbued with intrinsic value through both consumption and investment. While the dollar has a price, gold carries both price and enduring value.

Moreover, gold stands to gain from the ongoing de-dollarization trend and robust demand from the private sector. Structurally, we maintain a bullish outlook on gold. However, it's important to remain mindful of heightened volatility, driven by speculative positioning in the market, which could lead to sharp profit-taking and temporary reversals from time to time.

Price action suggests that gold is well-supported between the $2,530 and $2,540 levels in spot terms. On the MCX, a strong support zone is seen near ‚Çπ72,200. The strategy of buying on dips remains favorable. As a tactical move, traders may also consider covered positions. Given the likelihood of a slower pace of appreciation, a strategy involving long futures positions combined with selling far out-of-the-money (OTM) calls could offer attractive returns in such market conditions.




2Ô∏è‚É£ **SILVER**

__Intra day bias: Upward
Support levels: 88,200 & 86,950
Resistance levels: 90,800 and 91,200__

Silver is poised to outperform gold during uptrends, especially as base metal prices continue to hold firm despite the bearish news emerging from China. However, traders should be prepared for significantly higher volatility in silver compared to gold. As long as the post-FOMC low of $29.70 on spot remains intact, we maintain a buy-on-dips strategy around the $30.30-$30.50 region. Resistance may emerge near $31.70, but we anticipate that prices will eventually trend toward $32.50 and potentially even $33.

On the MCX, immediate support lies around ‚Çπ88,000, while the more significant and meaningful support zone is near ‚Çπ86,000. As long as prices stay above ‚Çπ86,000, we remain positionally bullish on silver and advocate buying on dips. Once silver approaches the $32.50 mark in spot prices, it could test the ‚Çπ93,500-‚Çπ94,000 levels on the MCX.",telegram,positive,0.8370866775512695,0.5858637700271606,0.5858637700271606,0.78768754,0.9601,0.0,1.0,1,0
2024-09-20,"6Ô∏è‚É£ **ZINC**

__Intra-day bias: Range bound
Support levels: 263 & 259
Resistance levels: 274 & 277__

Zinc prices are demonstrating resilience, and we anticipate a gradual upward drift, though likely within a broad range between ‚Çπ263 and ‚Çπ275. Traders looking to buy on dips should consider placing stop-losses below ‚Çπ262 to manage risk. On the other hand, those looking to short are advised to place stops above ‚Çπ277. While our overall bias remains slightly bullish, it's important to stay cautious and watch for any breakouts beyond this range.

__Intra day bias: Counter trend bounce
Support levels: 5850 & 5720
Resistance levels: 6050 and 6100
__

We turned tactically bullish on MCX crude oil above ‚Çπ5,700, with an initial target of ‚Çπ6,050, which was achieved yesterday. This call was driven by price action analysis, coupled with overwhelmingly bearish sentiment, where nearly everyone, from traders to analysts, seemed convinced oil was headed lower. Additionally, the market was bolstered by expectations of financial support from a potential Fed rate cut.

The question now is: what‚Äôs next? There is potential for further gains in crude, as the market may attempt to squeeze weak short positions, pushing prices toward ‚Çπ6,200. However, it‚Äôs important to note that ‚Çπ6,050 will present strong resistance, as this was a previous breakdown point. Traders might consider selling near this level, with stops placed just above, as a test of whether a fresh wave of selling will emerge. Points of role reversal, where support turns into resistance, often evoke strong bearish responses from traders, many of whom still carry the scars of getting caught in losing long positions.



**4Ô∏è‚É£ NATURAL GAS**

__Intra-day bias: Buy on dips
Support levels: 186 & 178
Resistance levels: 205 and 215__

Over the past 1.5 months, natural gas prices have been range-bound, fluctuating between the ‚Çπ170 and ‚Çπ205 levels on the spot market. Fundamental drivers for a breakout rally have been largely absent. Milder-than-expected summer temperatures across major cooling demand centers in the U.S. Midwest have kept gas offtake in check. Despite prices hitting 25-year lows on the Henry Hub spot market last March, there has not been a significant scale-back in production.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), natural gas production is projected to decline in 2024, down to 103.4 bcfd from the record high of 103.8 bcfd set in 2023. However, production is expected to rise again to 104.8 bcfd in 2025. While these figures may provide some medium-term context, a bullish trigger is still required for natural gas to break out and rally by 20-25% from current levels.

The forward curve remains humped, factoring in the anticipated winter demand surge, but the steep contango that was prevalent until a few weeks ago has reduced. For instance, the December-October contango, which was over $1 per MMBtu at the end of July, has now fallen to its lowest level this year, at 69 cents. While these premiums remain attractive for bearish traders to sell on the rise and roll their positions, the incentives are gradually diminishing.

We maintain a buy-on-dips strategy, with strong support identified near the ‚Çπ180 zone. However, if prices sustainably slip below ‚Çπ170, we would reconsider this view. One strategy that could be effective in the current range-bound environment is a covered call, where traders sell out-of-the-money (OTM) calls against their long positions. This strategy provides a cushion if prices remain confined within the current range.

Should natural gas break decisively above ‚Çπ205, we could see levels of ‚Çπ225 on the MCX, offering a clear opportunity for traders looking to capitalize on a breakout.




**5Ô∏è‚É£ COPPER**
__
Intra day bias: Range bound
Support levels: 810 & 800
Resistance levels: 822 & 834__

Mild drawdowns in Copper inventories on the LME, coupled with expectations of a Fed rate cut, have contributed to upward momentum in copper prices. International markets such as LME and COMEX have performed better than the domestic MCX, where strong resistance is observed around the ‚Çπ820/822 levels. However, as long as prices hold above the ‚Çπ795/796 zone, the metal is likely to trade with a positive bias, possibly developing a range between ‚Çπ800 and ‚Çπ822.

For traders, those looking to short should maintain a stop-loss above ‚Çπ822, while those looking to go long can enter near ‚Çπ800/803, with a stop-loss placed below ‚Çπ796. In the event of a sustained breakout above ‚Çπ822, we could see an upward move toward ‚Çπ834, offering further opportunities for bullish traders.",telegram,negative,0.8128225207328796,-0.20039824617385865,-0.20039824617385865,-0.11003649,-0.7269,0.0,1.0,0,1

We turned tactically bullish on natural gas when it was trading near the 190/195 levels. With a stop loss below 180, we recommended building positional long positions. Once prices broke above 205, the momentum accelerated, and there was no looking back as prices surged towards 222 on the front-month contract on MCX, and 240 on the October contract.

This rally marks a breakout from a prolonged consolidation range between 170 and 203. The next target is around 260-265 on the October futures contract. For fresh longs, we suggest buying on dips with a stop loss placed below 220 on a closing basis.

2024-09-24,"**China's Desperate Moves: PBoC Hints at Future Easing, Offers Direct Stock Support Amid Soaring Youth Unemployment**


China‚Äôs youth unemployment rate hit a fresh high of 18.8% in August, and in a desperate effort to bid up markets, the Chinese central bank is offering little more than lip service. With no firm timelines provided, the mere talk of future policy measures‚Äîsuch as a potential 50 basis point cut to the Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) and a possible reduction of the 7-day Reverse Repo rate to 1.5% from 1.7%‚Äîhas stirred Chinese equities, which are currently rallying, largely driven by short covering.

Base metals, energy, and bullion are also reacting positively, but this seems like nothing more than a short-lived central banking ""one-night stand,"" aimed at propping up markets for a few days.

Other proposed measures include lowering down payments for second homes and cutting outstanding mortgage rates for individual borrowers by an average of 0.5%. The Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF) may be lowered by 0.3%, and the Loan Prime Rate (LPR) could drop by 0.2% to 0.25%, but again, none of these come with a clear timeline.

However, what‚Äôs truly catching market attention is the PBoC‚Äôs unprecedented offer of direct support to stocks, allowing funds and brokers to tap central bank funding to buy equities. While this move seems extreme, it could undoubtedly boost Chinese equities in the short term. After all, who doesn‚Äôt enjoy higher stock prices? It appears the PBoC, feeling left out of the global equity rally, is now taking steps to join the party‚Äîalbeit through questionable and desperate measures designed to keep markets afloat for a brief moment.

The RRR will initially be cut by half a percentage point, in a move expected to free up about 1 trillion yuan ($142bn; ¬£106bn).

Mr Pan added that another cut may be made later in the year. (BBC)",telegram,positive,0.4516480267047882,0.19445156051158904,0.19445156051158904,0.27962312,0.2732,0.0,1.0,1,0

2024-09-24,"Silver's recent breakout three weeks ago pushed it towards our near-term target of $32 to $33 per ounce. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we anticipate silver could reach $50, with further upside targets of $75 within 24 to 36 months. In the long term, over the next 48 months, silver has the potential to surpass $100 per ounce.

Driving this surge is a chronic supply deficit, compounded by the growing demand from green energy initiatives. These themes could accelerate silver's ascent even faster than projected.

 At the peak of this potential silver bull market, we might witness a frenzy as investors rush to secure silver in the face of rapidly rising prices

**__"" Amateurs want to be right. Professionals want to make money‚Äù__**



1Ô∏è‚É£ **GOLD**

__Bias: Upward
Support levels: 74,900 & 74,400
Resistance levels: 75,600 and 76,100__


The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) continues to hover around the 100 level, struggling to break below this key psychological mark for the eighth time since early 2023. Despite dipping to 99.60 in July 2023, the DXY quickly rebounded toward 107, indicating strong underlying support for the dollar. This bounce suggests that any further downward pressure on the dollar may face resistance, and with U.S. short-duration yields appearing oversold, the possibility of a significant breakdown in the DXY looks limited.

Given these factors, the DXY and sovereign yields are unlikely to provide further downside momentum to boost gold prices in the near term. Instead, gold may need to rely on technical traders to drive momentum, especially as they are less influenced by broader macro trends.

Gold has been trading in a tight range, consolidating between $2,650 and $2,670 on the spot market (520-550 INR on MCX). The overall outlook remains bullish, with a buy-on-dip strategy as long as the price stays above $2,620 (around INR 74,000-74,200 on MCX). The near-term target is $2,700 on spot or INR 76,000-76,200 on MCX, with a stop-loss at $2,620 (or INR 74,000/74,200) aligned with COMEX price movements.

In essence, while macro catalysts might be lacking, technical conditions support a bullish stance, with limited downside risk as long as key levels hold.




**2Ô∏è‚É£ SILVER**

__Bias: Upward
Support levels: 91,500 & 90,700
Resistance levels: 93,000 and 93,600__

Silver remains in a consolidation phase, but the bias remains upward as long as prices hold above the $31.10/$30 zone on the spot market. We would maintain a buy strategy, with a stop-loss positioned just below $31 to manage risk.

The recent market excitement stems from news of potential Chinese stimulus measures and limited cash handouts for the absolute poor. While these developments are viewed as short-term catalysts and haven't fully materialized, they are being eagerly embraced by a market looking for bullish reasons to drive prices higher. This sentiment, even if fleeting, provides additional support for silver, particularly as base metals like copper move higher on the back of this news.

In the short term, silver could outperform gold, supported by this speculative boost. We expect upside targets in the $32.50/$32.60 range, with further gains toward $33.50 if momentum holds. On MCX, the stop-loss equivalent to $31 should translate to approximately INR 89,600. The support zone between INR 90,400 and INR 90,700 offers an attractive entry point for fresh long positions. If silver approaches the $32.50 target, MCX could climb toward INR 93,500/93,600.

Oil prices have dropped more than 4% over the last 24 hours, including a 2% decline since this morning, as concerns over potential supply disruptions in Libya eased. Libya‚Äôs rival factions reached an agreement on the process for appointing a central bank governor, a crucial step towards resolving the dispute that has disrupted control over the central bank and oil revenues, significantly affecting the country's oil output and exports.

On the technical front, crude prices on MCX are expected to test the September 10th low of INR 5,500 this week, with potential to decline further towards INR 5,400. A recent counter-trend rally failed at the resistance level of INR 6,050, which previously served as a breakdown point. This level now acts as a strong resistance zone, and with the current momentum favoring the downside, the bias remains bearish.",telegram,negative,0.7252161502838135,-0.1702901244163513,-0.1702901244163513,-0.69058025,0.875,0.0,1.0,0,1

__Bias: Upward
Support levels: 220 & 200
Resistance levels: 260 and 265__

Our tactical bullish call on natural gas near INR 190/195 has played out well, with prices surging as anticipated. While the risk-reward on fresh longs is not as compelling at current levels, the momentum remains strong. As such, unless we see a shift in price action, we prefer to wait for a pullback before entering new long positions.

Several factors have contributed to the recent price movement. Lower prices in the U.S. have led to production cuts, and increased demand in the power sector‚Äîwhere natural gas has been favored over pricier coal‚Äîhas slowed the pace of weekly natural gas injections. This has supported market rebalancing, with natural gas inventories, which were previously over 500 billion cubic feet above the five-year average, shrinking to less than 300 billion cubic feet.

In the U.S., traders are also closely watching Hurricane Helene, which has led to the shutdown of about 29% of crude production and 17% of natural gas output in the Gulf of Mexico. While the hurricane is expected to make landfall on the Florida coast, its impact on natural gas output may be limited. However, cooler and wetter weather due to the storm could negatively affect cooling demand.

Technically, natural gas has the potential to test the INR 255/260 levels on the MCX October contract, with a major support zone seen around INR 215/220. A buy-on-dip strategy remains advisable, with a stop-loss set below INR 210.




**5Ô∏è‚É£ COPPER**

__Bias: **Lipstick on the Pig can propel copper to 880**
Support levels: 835 & 820
Resistance levels: 855 & 870__

The latest Chinese stimulus is just another feeble attempt to slap lipstick on the proverbial pig. It‚Äôs all noise, no substance‚Äî""all fart and no poop."" Yet, global risk sentiment, juiced up by central banks‚Äô never-ending cocktail of easy money, keeps the party going long after the lights should‚Äôve been turned off. In this extended bender, even a half-hearted Chinese effort is treated like groundbreaking news.

Let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôs not the weight of the news but the timing. The Chinese economy has been a slow-motion train wreck for ages‚Äîovercapacity, supply glut, and dwindling demand. A 50 bps rate cut and liquidity injection are like putting a Band-Aid on a broken leg. With interest rates hovering near one percent and loans dictated by government mandate rather than market forces, the Chinese central bank‚Äôs foreplay with its reference rates is not going to stir much excitement.

That said, in a world where fund managers are scraping the bottom of the barrel for anything to buy, even under-owned Chinese equities might offer some relief. It‚Äôs not about fundamentals anymore; it‚Äôs about finding something‚Äîanything‚Äîto pour money into.

As for base metals, the market lapped up the stimulus news, mainly because it was short. Copper could ride this momentum up to 875/880, fueled by a few days of stock withdrawals or a jump in canceled warrants. Technically, the bias remains upward as long as prices hold above 820, but let‚Äôs not pretend this rally is based on anything other than market reflex and sentiment.

2024-09-30,"**Financial Play of China: A Brand New Shade of Lipstick on the Pig**



Here‚Äôs a comprehensive list of measures announced by China since September 23, 2024, to stimulate its economy.



1>>** Monetary Measures:**



a) Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) Cut: 

Reduced by 0.5 percentage points, releasing 1 trillion yuan ($141 billion) in liquidity. But hey, isn‚Äôt this the same playbook of trying to pour money into an economy hoping people will actually borrow it this time?



b) Interest Rate Cuts: 

Seven-day reverse repo rate cut from 1.7% to 1.5%, lowering loan prime rates and deposit rates. Because if throwing money at banks didn‚Äôt work before, maybe lower interest rates will?




2>> **Property Market Support:**


a) Mortgage Rate Reduction: 

A 0.5% cut in mortgage rates for existing home loans, benefiting 50 million households. Sure, reducing mortgage rates while the housing market is tanking always looks good on paper.


b) Down Payment Requirement:

Reduced for second-home buyers from 25% to 15%. Yeah, because clearly people are lining up to buy second homes in a crumbling property market.


c) Re-lending for Unsold Housing: 

The government will now cover 100% of loans for local governments to purchase unsold homes, up from the previous 60%. If there‚Äôs one way to deal with oversupply, it‚Äôs by pushing it onto local governments!




3>> **Stock Market and Financial Sector:**


a) Stock Market Liquidity Support: 

800 billion yuan ($113 billion) liquidity support, including a 500 billion yuan swap facility for brokers and 300 billion yuan for refinancing stock buybacks. Nothing like cheap money to inflate stock prices for a few months!


b) Capital Market Reforms:

Plans to encourage mergers and acquisitions and ease restrictions on private equity and venture capital. Because consolidation has clearly worked wonders for the economy so far, right?




4>> **Fiscal and Consumer Support:**


a) Fiscal Spending Boost: 

The Politburo pledged to increase fiscal spending and prevent further property price declines, with an emphasis on stimulating consumption. Looks like fiscal spending is the lipstick on the proverbial pig this time.


b) Cash Handouts and Subsidies: 

Targeted at jobless graduates and vulnerable groups to promote consumption. A quick cash boost while ignoring the broader economic realities‚Äîwho wouldn‚Äôt love a little retail therapy?




5>> **Support for Private Firms:**


Full Support to Private Enterprises: 

The National Development and Reform Commission vowed to assist private firms, calling them vital to economic recovery. At least they're calling them ""vital"" again‚Äînice to see private firms back in the good books after years of crackdowns!



**China‚Äôs latest stimulus measures are part** of its ongoing attempt to stabilize growth, boost market confidence, and hit that elusive 5% GDP target. Sure, sentiment in stocks, commodities, and currencies has improved ‚Äì but let's be real: without a significant boost in actual consumer spending, the economic impact will fizzle out soon enough.


The package hits all the right notes for traders: a nod to consumption, talk of housing prices, and support for the private sector. This is exactly the narrative they needed to justify quick bets on Chinese markets. And don't forget, we‚Äôre riding a global liquidity wave thanks to the Fed and other central banks, which makes it easier to swallow these surface-level reforms and gamble on China in the short term.


**In the end, this would lead to more short-term gains in Chinese stocks, higher commodity prices, and maybe even a little bump in oil. But let's not kid ourselves‚Äîthese are mostly cosmetic changes in a market hungry for quick profits.**

------



We are approaching a period where implied volatility is expected to surge, driven by traders hedging tail risk and increasing demand for out-of-the-money (OTM) options.

 Notably, OTM calls may experience a stronger bid for implied volatility compared to puts, reflecting a positive skew as geopolitical risk premia‚Äîespecially around the Israel-Iran tensions‚Äîbecomes more pronounced.

Given this environment, options present a more strategic vehicle for positioning in crude oil markets compared to futures. As implied volatility rises, so do option premiums, making volatility-sensitive strategies more attractive. 

Conversely, should volatility retreat, premiums will adjust accordingly. This dynamic underscores the value of utilizing options over futures in volatile market conditions, where risk management and premium considerations play a pivotal role.

2024-10-03,"**Potential Impact on Iran‚Äôs Oil and Gas Production During a Conflict with Israel**



In the event of an all-out war between Iran and Israel, Iran‚Äôs oil and gas production and exports could face significant disruptions, with wide-reaching implications for the global energy market.


Oil Disruptions:


Key Infrastructure Vulnerability: Iran's major oil export terminals, such as Kharg Island and Sirri Island, are critical to its export operations. These could be prime targets in a conflict, potentially halting up to 1.6-1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil exports. Damage to these facilities could dramatically reduce the country's ability to supply oil.


Refining and Storage: Attacks on refineries in Bandar Abbas or Abadan could cripple Iran‚Äôs refined product exports, which contribute 240,000-300,000 bpd to its total oil-related exports.


Strait of Hormuz: This vital shipping lane, through which 20% of the world‚Äôs oil passes, could become a focal point of the conflict. Any disruptions here would not only impact Iran but also global energy supplies.


Gas Disruptions:


Pipeline Vulnerabilities: Iran's major gas export pipelines, such as the Tabriz-Ankara pipeline to Turkey, could be targeted. This pipeline carries 9-10 bcm/year of natural gas, a significant share of Iran‚Äôs total exports.


Domestic Gas Supply: The South Pars gas field, which powers much of Iran‚Äôs domestic energy needs, could also be disrupted, impacting 1 bcm/day of natural gas production, leading to power outages and industrial slowdowns.


Total Potential Disruption:


Oil Exports: Up to 100% of Iran's crude oil exports (1.6-1.7 million bpd) could be jeopardized.


Gas Exports: Around 17-20 bcm/year of natural gas exports, especially to Turkey and Iraq, could be halted.


Domestic Supply: Iran‚Äôs internal energy consumption could also suffer due to damage to key gas fields and refineries, causing widespread energy shortages.


This potential disruption would have significant consequences not only for Iran but for the global energy market, especially if conflict escalates to affect the Strait of Hormuz.

2024-10-04,"**Crude Oil Update**

WTI crude oil surpassed $74 per barrel yesterday, driven by concerns that Israel might target Iranian oil rigs in retaliation after President Biden mentioned that a strike on Iran‚Äôs oil facilities is being considered. 

Oil prices surged by 5%, marking the largest single-day increase in nearly a year, and are set for an 8% weekly rise as the escalating Israel-Iran conflict heightens fears of disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz, directly affecting Middle Eastern oil supplies. 

Today, WTI crude has held its gains and trades near $73.6 per barrel as markets remain anxious about the potential for a wider regional conflict.

Comex Gold prices recovered after hitting a daily low of $2,657, settling above $2,679, driven by rising fears over the Israel-Iran conflict and a stronger US Dollar. The US Dollar Index (DXY) gained 0.35%, reaching 101.95, as bets on aggressive Federal Reserve easing faded. Labor market data revealed that US Initial Jobless Claims rose to 225K, exceeding estimates of 220K, while Factory Orders contracted by -0.2%, missing the expected 0%. However, the ISM Services PMI expanded to 54.9 in September.

Geopolitical tensions escalated as Israel advanced into Lebanon following a missile attack by Iran, while US President Joe Biden discussed potential strikes on Iranian oil facilities. Federal Reserve officials signaled caution, with Chicago Fed‚Äôs Austan Goolsbee emphasizing a steady approach to rate cuts, as inflation appears on target.

Traders now eye Friday‚Äôs Non-farm Payrolls report, expecting 140K jobs added in September, slightly below August‚Äôs 142K, with the unemployment rate forecast to remain unchanged at 4.2%.

2024-10-04,"The *NCDEX Cocud December contract* has been under pressure this week, driven primarily by lower demand at elevated price levels. Currently, prices for the new season Cocud are up approximately 5% y/y.
On a daily chart,  the immediate resistance zone is seen in the 3,045-3,110. A break and sustained above this level could push prices higher towards 3,440. Further resistances are noted at 3,640 and 3,825, and if momentum continues beyond these levels, prices could potentially test 4,400 before the December expiry.

On the downside, the key support is observed at 2,835, and a recovery from these levels is anticipated. However, if this support is breached, the next support level is 2,650, with further declines potentially extending towards the 2,500 mark.

Overall, the market's near-term trajectory will largely depend on demand dynamics and price action around these critical technical levels.

During such periods, silver often tends to decline more sharply than gold, leading to an increase in the gold/silver ratio as silver becomes relatively cheaper.

This trend underscores silver's dual nature as both an industrial and precious metal, making it more sensitive to shifts in economic conditions and market sentiment compared to gold. Keep an eye on further movements in the dollar and base metals for potential impacts on silver's performance.**

2024-10-08,"***China's gold reserves unchanged for fifth straight month in September***

(Reuters)

China's central bank held back on buying gold for its reserves for a fifth straight month in September, official data showed on Monday, mainly due to a surge in prices for the yellow metal.

China's gold holdings stood at 72.8 million troy ounces at the end of last month. The value of the gold reserves, however, rose to $191.47 billion from $182.98 billion at the end of August.

Gold prices have risen around 28% so far this year - heading for the biggest annual gain in 14 years - underpinned by the start of U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, geopolitical tensions and robust demand from central banks.

Global central banks, which actively bought gold in 2022-2023, are on track to slow purchases in 2024 from 2023, according to the World Gold Council, but to keep them above the pre-2022 level.

**India's gold imports witnessed a significant surge in August, reaching a three-and-a-half-year high of 125 tonnes**. This marked a substantial increase of 58% year-on-year and 212% month-on-month. 

The surge was primarily driven by a combination of factors, including stronger consumer demand and industry restocking ahead of the upcoming festive season. 

The reduction in import tariffs on precious metals in July further incentivized purchases, as consumers who had delayed purchases due to higher gold prices in the first half of 2024 took advantage of the lower tariffs.

2024-10-08,"**Bullion Under Pressure: Silver Slips as Geopolitical Tensions and Strong Dollar Tug Gold Lower**


Over the weekend, we highlighted two significant risks in the bullion market: first, the record-high long positions, and second, the sharp breakout move in the U.S. Dollar, which we anticipated early on from 100.50. Despite these risks, gold and silver prices held up, primarily due to heightened geopolitical tensions and an increased risk premium. A notable 17% rally in crude oil further supported bullion, countering the headwinds from a strong dollar and rising U.S. yields.

Today, however, crude opened lower as the market anticipates a limited escalation in West Asia. Additionally, disappointment stemming from China‚Äôs NDRC press conference led to a sharp sell-off in base metals. As the U.S. Dollar Index ticked higher, base metals dropped, causing silver to take a bigger hit than gold. Gold also followed the downward trend.

Our earlier warnings on these risks were clear from the chart signals. Currently, major support for silver lies near $30, but a slide towards $29.00‚Äì$29.20 on spot is possible if the substantial long positions on COMEX unwind. In the Indian market, this could translate to a price level around 86,000 rupees. Gold may also face additional pressure in the near term.

We‚Äôll be sharing updated charts shortly.

The latest economic data from the US presents a mixed picture, characterized by sticky inflation and a rise in unemployment, complicating the Federal Reserve's future policy decisions.

In response to this data, swaps traders have slightly increased their bets on a quarter-point rate cut in November. However, they remain cautious about fully pricing it in as they assess the risks associated with the labor market and ongoing inflationary pressures.

Higher-than-expected inflation allows the Federal Reserve some leeway to continue cutting interest rates. As a result, the dollar and Treasury yields have edged lower, while Comex gold has recovered from $2,618 per ounce to $2,640 per ounce.

The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose more than anticipated last month, increasing by 0.2% on a monthly basis and 2.4% year-over-year, surpassing expectations of 0.1% and 2.3%, respectively. Conversely, jobless claims surged by 33,000 in the week ending October 5, reaching 258,000‚Äîthe highest level of initial claims since early August 2023.

2024-10-10,"**For Traders with Low Transaction Costs: Hedged Strategies to Limit Risk**

**

If transaction costs are minimal, traders can explore strategies that offer profit potential similar to a short straddle but with reduced risk and margin requirements. Instead of a high-risk, unhedged short straddle or short strangle, consider these hedged alternatives:**


1Ô∏è‚É£** Short Iron Fly**

Structure: A short straddle hedged with a long, far OTM (Out-of-The-Money) strangle in the same expiry.

**Benefits:**

Limits potential losses on extreme price movements, mitigating tail risk.

Significantly lowers margin requirements, enhancing capital efficiency.


**Ideal For: **Traders seeking risk protection while maintaining profit potential in a volatile market.


**
2Ô∏è‚É£ Short Iron Condor**

Structure: A short strangle hedged with a long, further OTM strangle, positioning the short legs closer to ATM (At-The-Money) strikes.

**Benefits:**

Provides tail risk coverage on substantial price shifts.

Reduces margin requirements due to the added hedge.


**Ideal For: **Traders aiming for controlled risk exposure with lower margin demands.


**
Important Considerations:**

**Transaction Costs:** Both the short iron fly and short iron condor require four options positions‚Äîtwo to initiate and two to close. With four legs to manage, transaction costs can add up quickly.

**
Low-Cost Trading: **These strategies are best suited for traders with very low trading costs, as high fees could significantly impact profitability.



**__By choosing a hedged approach like the short iron fly or short iron condor, traders can achieve capital-efficient risk management while navigating markets with elevated volatility.__**

**Fiscal Support:**

China has unveiled a $325 billion fiscal package, its most substantial economic support since the global financial crisis, aimed at stimulating the economy over the next three months.


**Special Bond Issuance: **

Approximately 2.3 trillion yuan in special bonds will be issued to provide capital for state-owned banks, support the property market, and help local governments manage debt and increase spending on infrastructure.


**Local Government Debt Relief: **

Local governments will have a higher debt ceiling, enabling more infrastructure investment and job protection. This measure is critical for regions heavily reliant on property revenue.


**Support for Banks and Mortgage Relief: 

T**op Chinese banks, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, will lower interest rates on existing mortgages starting October 25. The adjustments will be automatic, intended to alleviate the debt burden on consumers and stimulate housing demand.


**Monetary Easing:

**Recent moves by the central bank include interest rate cuts, a liquidity boost, and a 500 billion yuan ‚Äúswap facility‚Äù to stabilize capital markets and support stock purchases.


**Incremental Reforms and ‚ÄúCounter-Cyclical‚Äù Measures:**

China will introduce more gradual fiscal and monetary interventions, indicating a long-term approach to managing deflationary pressures and strengthening consumer confidence.


**Economic Growth Challenges: **

The government is targeting 5% growth for 2024. However, challenges like low consumer spending and a reliance on investment-driven growth pose risks to sustainable recovery, suggesting that additional actions may be necessary to achieve long-term economic stability.


**The metal markets, having anticipated these moves, will be closely watched to see if there's profit-taking on Monday. However, China's consistent market support through frequent communication could sustain positive sentiment for metals and bullion in the coming weeks. Specifically:**


**Zinc and Aluminum:

**Likely to rally further given the current support environment.


**Copper:** 

Expected to remain well-supported as demand stabilizes.


**Gold and Silver:** 

Strong demand has emerged at recent lower levels, with gold near 74,700 and silver near 88,000. As long as these levels hold, the bias is upward, potentially setting the stage for new price highs.


These levels are key indicators for ongoing market trends, and sustained support at these points could lead to continued upward momentum.

Gold is gaining momentum and nearing all-time highs, with recent upside likely driven by positive comments from central banks and a bullish outlook from industry participants.

Recently, reserve managers from the central banks of Mexico, Mongolia, and the Czech Republic publicly supported increasing gold holdings at the LBMA conference, in a rare occurrence. They indicated that the percentage of gold in their countries' reserves is likely to rise in the coming years due to growing geopolitical tensions and declining interest rates.

Additionally, a recent survey at the London Bullion Market Association event in Miami suggests that gold is expected to reach record highs within the next year. Delegates anticipate that the price of the precious metal will rise to $2,917.40 an ounce by late October next year, approximately 10% higher than current levels.

2024-10-17,"Better-than-expected retail sales and jobless claims figures indicate resilience in the U.S. economy, keeping the Federal Reserve on track for modest rate cuts and pushing the dollar toward 104. This underscores strong consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity in the US, and suggests that the labor market is stabilizing after earlier signs of weakness over the summer. US equities are responding positively to the data, with the S&P 500 reaching a record high, as this data is easing fears of a recession and raising hopes for a soft landing.

Retail sales rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in September, up from an unrevised 0.1% increase in August and surpassing expectations of a 0.3% rise. Additionally, initial unemployment claims fell to a seasonally adjusted 241,000, down 19,000 from the previous week‚Äôs total of 260,000.

Meanwhile, Comex gold prices are nearing record highs, supported by anticipated dovish policies from major central banks, ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming U.S. elections.

According to CME's FedWatch Tool, there is over a 90% chance that the Federal Reserve will reduce borrowing costs by 25 basis points in its November meeting.

One event we are closely watching is the upcoming BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, from October 22 to 24, 2024. If this recent movement in gold is connected to geopolitical or strategic developments among BRICS nations, it could shed light on the underlying drivers.

We‚Äôll keep a close eye on the situation and provide updates as it unfolds. For now, let‚Äôs enjoy the ride.**

WTI crude has fallen below $69 per barrel, marking a decline of over 6%, the largest weekly drop since the last week of September. Weakness in oil intensified further today by slowing economic growth in China and a reduction in supply disruptions in the Middle East. China's GDP grew by 4.6% in the September quarter compared to a year earlier, representing its slowest growth since the first quarter of 2023.

The downward pressure on oil prices this week has also been fueled by lowered demand growth projections from OPEC and the IEA, a decrease in China's refinery output, and the resumption of production and exports from Libya.

2024-10-18,"*Gold Update*

Comex Gold prices surged past $2,735 per ounce, hitting a record high as safe-haven demand grew and is on track for a weekly gain of over 2%. Comex Silver climbed above $33 per ounce on Friday, touched its highest since Dec 2012, tracking a rally in gold prices.

This rally in Bullions is largely driven by expectations of further interest rate cuts by major central banks, with the European Central Bank lowering its deposit rate to 3.25%‚Äîits third cut this year‚Äîindicating that inflation control is progressing. Heightened tensions in the Middle East also boosted gold, after Israel confirmed the death of Yahya Sinwar, a key Hamas leader, sparking fears of wider regional conflict.

Meanwhile, investors turned to gold as a safer asset amid disappointing fiscal policies from China, aimed at addressing its ongoing property crisis, and concerns over the US presidential election's potential impact on global markets. According to a World Gold Council (WGC) report, Gold ETFs have seen consistent inflows globally for the fifth month in a row in September that has led to a five percent increase in AUM to $271 billion worldwide and collective holdings climbed 18 tonne to 3,200 tonne by the end of September 2024.

However, strong US economic data may limit gold's momentum by suggesting that Federal Reserve may take a less dovish approach than expected, tempering further gains for bullion prices.  Overall, global uncertainties and central bank actions continue to fuel demand for gold, while economic resilience in the US may curbs its rise.

2024-10-21,"**Silver remains in a powerful uptrend, and historical data from the past decade indicates that after a 6%+ rally in a single session, there‚Äôs a strong tendency for the uptrend to continue into the next trading day. However, from the second or third day onward, we often see profit-taking, which can lead to a temporary dip.

We have maintained a bullish outlook on both gold and silver for some time. Last Friday morning, before the market opened and even midday, we advised going long on silver with a target of $33.50 to $34.00, anticipating that silver would catch up to gold as base metal prices showed signs of recovery and global markets moved into a risk-on sentiment. The upcoming BRICS summit will be a key event for bullion traders, and we‚Äôll be closely monitoring announcements that could impact the precious metals market.

Silver has already achieved our initial targets within 24 hours. There is potential for this rally to extend toward the $35.50 to $35.80 zone. However, we advise traders to take smaller positions on fresh longs and wait for a sharper pullback toward the $32.50 to $33.00 range before committing to larger long positions. For positional trades, stop-losses should be placed just below Friday‚Äôs low of $31.60.**

Given this outlook, we recommend waiting for a pullback toward the 5920-5950 range to initiate fresh short positions, with a stop-loss placed above 6000.

2024-10-21,"**MCX natural gas prices faced a challenging week, continuing their downtrend as mild weather forecasts in the U.S. kept demand subdued. The primary driver behind the ongoing decline was the unexpectedly warm weather across much of the country.

U.S. natural gas storage levels have also remained high, with total working gas in storage at 3,705 Bcf‚Äî107 Bcf higher than last year and 163 Bcf above the five-year average. These elevated storage levels have limited any upside potential, reinforcing the bearish sentiment despite the approach of the winter heating season.

However, the price action, combined with forecasts of dipping temperatures starting in the first and second weeks of November across major heating centers in the U.S., has created the possibility of a near-term bottom in natural gas prices between 180-190 rupees on the front-month contract. With the November contract trading at a 42-rupee premium, we could see this premium contract as natural gas prices recover, given that far-month contracts have dropped less due to pricing in the winter season demand. As a result, the short-covering rally could be stronger in the front-month than in the far-month futures, leading to a contraction in the premium.

Therefore, traders are advised to book profits on their short positions. Those looking to go long should consider using call spreads on the November contract, as they provide limited risk due to the hedged nature of the trade. The target for this strategy can be 202/204 rupees. In case of a clear breakout above 204 with volume, we could see a larger bullish trend reversal unfold.**

2024-10-22,"**The ongoing powerful uptrend suggests a continuation of buying, with additional positions to be added on any dips. Resistance is anticipated near the upper boundary of the rising channel, though a more significant resistance is around the 2810 level. This confluence is marked by two key factors: it aligns with 1.61 times the September-October decline and coincides with the 100% projection of the rally from the October 9th lows.

During an uptrend, the lower band of the rising channel holds more significance than the upper band, as it provides key support. Conversely, in a downtrend, the upper band assumes greater importance as a resistance level.

Should gold manage to move toward the 2810 level in the coming weeks, MCX Gold could potentially test the 80,200‚Äì80,500 range. Key support is found between the 2655‚Äì2670 zone, which correlates with the 76,000 levels on MCX.

2024-10-24,"**Zinc Update**

LME zinc soared to $3,246 per tonne, the highest level since February 2023, as backwardation steepened sharply this week, indicating that spot demand is outpacing supply. Cash zinc contracts are trading at a $58.25 premium to three-month futures on the LME, marking the highest premium since September 2022, a notable shift from the discount observed last week.

The pricing structure moved to backwardation last Friday following a recent blow to mine supply. According to Sibanye-Stillwater announcement on Friday, the Century zinc operation in Queensland, Australia, has been suspended due to regional bushfires, and output this quarter is expected to fall short by nearly 9,680 tonnes due to the stoppage, which is likely to last until mid-November. Century produced 76,000 tonnes of zinc last year.

Data from the exchange indicates that one individual buyer has acquired between 50% and 80% of the readily available zinc inventories in the LME‚Äôs warehousing network over the past week. In the futures market, this entity has also purchased at least 40% of the main November-delivery zinc contracts, which would allow them to claim more inventory than is available in the system if held to expiration.

The squeeze on supply, combined with optimism about potential policy easing in China ahead of the National People's Congress (NPC) meeting later this month, could pave the way for further gains in zinc prices.

2024-10-30,"**Election Frenzy: High Stakes, Rising Yields, and Market Moves to Watch**


With the US presidential election now less than a week away, the event holds significant implications for the economy. Rising yields and a stronger dollar suggest that markets may be pricing in a Trump victory, a scenario associated with larger fiscal deficits, higher tariffs, and potential political gridlock over the debt ceiling. These factors could be inflationary, potentially increasing the market‚Äôs risk premium. On the flip side, Trump‚Äôs ""America First"" policy and job reshoring initiatives may benefit US equities. 


During his first term, Trump was vocal about lower interest rates and higher stock valuations. However, surprises are common in elections, and a comeback from Harris could unsettle traders‚Äô current expectations. We will keep a close watch on developments as the election nears.


Leading up to major national elections, like we observed in Bharat in June, markets tend to adopt a cautious stance. Current positioning reports indicate a similar sentiment among US market participants, suggesting a subdued tone in commodities ahead of the event. Gold remains strong and may trend higher to reach fresh all-time highs, while silver may consolidate, as a stronger dollar and higher US rates could cap the upside. 


Range trading may be the preferred approach through Wednesday. However, any sharp dip in spot silver toward $32.30‚Äì$32.80 or MCX prices between ‚Çπ96,000‚Äì‚Çπ97,500 could offer opportunities for accumulation, with a positional stop below ‚Çπ94,800 and a target around ‚Çπ1.10 lakh over the next few months. If silver falls below ‚Çπ94,800, we would exit longs and reassess.


For base metals, next week will be critical, with Chinese policymakers expected to announce a substantial stimulus, potentially around 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion). Given China‚Äôs annual GDP of approximately $18‚Äì$19 trillion, this move could support a ""buy on dips"" strategy in base metals.


Oil prices are likely to remain range-bound, making short straddle or strangle options attractive to capitalize on high option premiums or implied volatility. Natural gas may trend higher as winter demand picks up, with support near the 225‚Äì230 levels.


**While many studies analyze the impact of elections on commodities, equities, currencies, and bonds, we view such studies as coincident rather than predictive. Each election occurs within a unique context, and attempting to draw conclusions from historical studies without context is like designing a plane without knowing whether it‚Äôs intended for commercial or combat use. Therefore, we suggest our readers approach these studies with caution. Instead, as the election passes, we could see risk assets perform well as the uncertainty dissipates.**

Source: World Gold Council 

*Key Figures*

- LBMA PM gold price: $2,474/oz (Q3 average)
- OTC investment: 137 tonnes (97% y/y increase)
- Total gold supply: 1,313 tonnes (5% y/y growth)
- Mine production: 6% y/y growth
- Recycled gold volumes: 11% y/y increase

*The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) PM* gold price continued its upward trajectory in Q3 2024, breaching successive record highs. The average price for the quarter reached a record $2,474/oz, representing a 28% year-over-year (y/y) increase.

*Over-the-counter (OTC)* investment in gold surged, almost doubling y/y to 137 tonnes. This marked the seventh consecutive quarter of positive OTC investment demand, underscoring gold's enduring appeal. Total gold supply expanded 5% y/y to a record 1,313 tonnes, driven by:

- 6% y/y growth in mine production, reaching another quarterly record
- 11% y/y increase in recycled gold volumes, although widespread distress selling remains absent

*Investment flows* played a pivotal role in gold's Q3 performance, fueled by:

- Falling interest rates
- Geopolitical uncertainty
- Portfolio diversification
- Momentum buying

*Looking ahead to 2024's full-year outlook:*

- Resurgent professional flows and solid bar and coin investment will offset weaker consumer demand
- Central bank buying is expected to slow, but remain supportive

The gold market's resilience is evident, with diverse drivers underpinning demand. As investors seek safe-haven assets and diversification, gold's appeal is likely to persist.

2024-11-08,"**Using a Collar Strategy to Manage Risk on Long Gold Positions**


Traders who are currently holding long positions in gold and were unable to exit during the post-election breakdown can consider a collar strategy to limit their mark-to-market exposure without fully closing their positions.

In a collar strategy, a trader who is long futures can use options to create downside protection while capping upside potential. Here‚Äôs how it would work in this scenario:

For a long gold futures position, you could sell a call option to generate premium and then use that premium to purchase a protective put. Specifically, consider selling a 78,000-strike gold mini call (with expiration on 26th November) and using the collected premium to buy a 76,500-strike put as protection. Ensure that the quantity in all legs matches the quantity of the futures position to maintain balanced exposure.

This setup establishes a price floor at the put strike (76,500), providing downside protection, while the call strike (78,000) limits potential upside gains. The premium collected from selling the call partially or fully funds the protective put, minimizing the overall cost of this strategy.

2024-11-08,"Silver‚Äôs anticipated rebound has played out. Investors are now watching closely as Beijing wraps up its five-day meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) later today. The market is awaiting details on China‚Äôs stimulus measures, expected to be released either today or over the weekend. Should the stimulus package fall short of expectations, a potential drop in base metals could also weigh on silver prices, presenting a notable event risk for silver traders.

Silver‚Äôs price action remains bearish, having rebounded into the previous support-turned-resistance zone above $32.00, only to pull back again. As long as prices stay below $32.30, the bearish outlook is intact, with key support levels around $30.00 and $29.40. However, if silver moves above $32.30, a reassessment of the bearish outlook would be warranted.

2024-11-08,"The US Federal Reserve recently cut interest rates by 25 basis points, as expected, and indicated the possibility of further cuts. In response, market expectations for the terminal Fed funds rate have shifted significantly over the past month, moving from around 3% to a range of 3.75-4%. This notable shift reflects a growing belief among traders that Trump's ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù policies could help buffer the economy against a sharper slowdown and potentially fuel inflation.

While more clarity on the new administration‚Äôs policies will unfold in the coming weeks, the effect on commodities like gold and silver has already been visible. Both metals initially rebounded, but gold encountered a key support-turned-resistance trendline at $2,720, establishing it as a critical resistance point. This ‚Äúrole reversal‚Äù suggests potential for further downside in gold, although price signals from the US Dollar Index and long-term bond yields indicate there may still be room for a downward correction in both.

It remains to be seen whether this will lend support to gold. However, based on current price action, further declines seem likely as long as gold remains below $2,720. Key support levels to monitor are $2,600 and a deeper level around $2,530. If prices break back above $2,720, however, it would warrant a re-evaluation of this bearish outlook.

2024-11-08,"üáÆüá≥ *India Cotton Update*

(Source:Cotton Outlook)

In October, India‚Äôs cotton arrivals accelerated, reaching over 100,000 bales per day, earlier than the typical seasonal pattern. This increase is expected to provide ample domestic supply for Indian mills, contributing to market stability. 

Meanwhile, market observers are closely watching the Cotton Corporation of India‚Äôs (CCI) procurement plans under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme. Initial projections for MSP-backed purchases ranged from eight to 18 million bales, but a rise in ICE futures in late September led to scaled-back estimates of around 6-8 million bales. 

However, the subsequent decline in ICE futures throughout October could prompt a renewed interest in imports, potentially influencing CCI‚Äôs MSP procurement levels if domestic arrivals intensify.

*India‚Äôs cotton landscape* is also impacted by global demand trends. The country‚Äôs cotton output outlook remains optimistic, supported by improved weather conditions in key growing regions. 

The overall world cotton outlook also reflects India‚Äôs significant contribution, with Cotton Outlook adjusting its global production forecast upward due to higher expectations for India and China. 

With production anticipated to surpass consumption, India is likely to benefit from elevated stock levels, presenting opportunities for further price stabilization and bolstering its domestic cotton ecosystem.

2024-11-08,"China has approved a 6 trillion yuan ($839billion) program to refinance local government debt, as Beijing rolls out more measures to support a slowing economy facing new risks from the reelection of Donald Trump.

The plan by the Standing Committee of the National People‚Äôs Congress was reported by the Xinhua News Agency on Friday, which provided few details as officials began to brief reporters in Beijing. It provides more clarity for many investors who‚Äôve been awaiting a fuller picture of China‚Äôs promised fiscal measures to revive confidence. 

China‚Äôs economy grew 4.6% in the third quarter, the weakest pace since March last year, putting in doubt Beijing‚Äôs ability to hit its annual expansion target of around 5%. That slowdown prompted policymakers to pivot toward more supportive policies, including interest-rate cuts and help for the stock and real estate markets.

The shift in late September triggered a historic stock rally and driven global banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to upgrade their forecasts for the $18 trillion economy, although Trump‚Äôs election victory has fueled calls on Beijing to strengthen policies to boost domestic demand to offset a potential drop in exports due to the president-elect‚Äôs tariff threats.

2024-11-08,"**China rolls-out 6 Trillion Yuan stimulus to bolster economy:
**
At the conclusion of the China's NPC, the standing committee has approved the much awaited stimulus measure.

China‚Äôs National People‚Äôs Congress (NPC) has approved a major 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) debt swap program to help alleviate local government debt, part of a broader stimulus effort to support a slowing economy. 

This measure aims to improve the fiscal stability as China faces new challenges, including the potential impact of renewed U.S. tariffs under President Trump‚Äôs re-election. 

However, investor response so far indicates they aren't satisfied with this announcement. The Yuan has weakened, yields on China‚Äôs 10-year government bonds have dipped, and key commodities like gold, crude, and copper have edged lower. 

This cautious market reaction signals doubts about the stimulus package‚Äôs ability to effectively counterbalance China‚Äôs economic slowdown, highlighted by its modest 4.6% growth in the third quarter.

This setup suggests a potential buying opportunity if prices approach the 230-234 support area, where traders can enter a long position. A stop-loss can be placed just below 230 to manage downside risk, with an initial target around 245. If the uptrend resumes, there may be potential for further gains.

2024-11-11,"**The market dynamics have unfolded in a manner reminiscent of the post-2016 U.S. Presidential election period. Between November and mid-December, U.S. equities and cryptocurrencies have outperformed other asset classes. Market drivers include the fear of higher inflation, concerns about increased deficits, and robust U.S. growth, which have together propelled yields higher, strengthened the U.S. Dollar, and exerted downward pressure on both emerging market equities and precious metals.

However, this time, Trump‚Äôs anticipated policy stance diverges significantly from his first term, and the global backdrop has shifted as well. Whereas the Fed was tightening in 2016, they are now taking a more accommodative stance. While it's true the Fed has recently signaled a more measured pace in its rate cuts, and bond markets have adjusted their terminal rate expectations from below 3% to nearly 4%, the policy environment remains comparatively supportive. We expect the Trump administration to take a more forceful and abrupt approach to deglobalization, which could intensify the ongoing trend of de-dollarization. This shift isn't limited to trade; it extends to immigration policies, corporate regulations, and offshore operations of foreign entities. Such moves may provoke retaliatory responses from major economies, potentially unravelling global trade links over the next 24 to 36 months.

Additionally, Trump has hinted at slashing bureaucracy and targeting government jobs. It‚Äôs important to note that the U.S. government remains the country‚Äôs largest employer, and any significant downsizing could have far-reaching impacts. Combined with reduced regulation and lower corporate taxes, this ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù approach aims to foster self-reliance at the cost of a world that might become less dependent on the U.S. Dollar for commerce, finance, and trade. These developments will be closely monitored in the months and quarters ahead.

Turning to the gold market, rising yields and a stronger U.S. Dollar have pressured gold prices, leading to notable corrections. CFTC data indicates profit-taking from record-high speculative long positions. Technically, as long as gold remains below USD 2720 on the spot market, the bias remains downward. Key support levels are near USD 2600 and then USD 2530. However, sustained trading above USD 2720 would prompt a shift to a bullish view.**

2024-11-11,"**Crude oil currently lacks a definitive catalyst for a strong directional trend. Market fundamentals remain bearish, with weak demand and ample supply weighing on prices. However, the potential escalation of the Israel-Iran conflict continues to support a geopolitical risk premium in the market. With Trump back in the White House, there is an argument that West Asia could shift towards a more stable period, as diplomatic or strategic pressures may lead to a resolution of the Israel-Iran standoff. As Israel tightens its position on Iran, a de-escalation could indeed unfold, potentially lowering the geopolitical premium in oil prices.

As a result, oil may trade within a range rather than seeing a significant rally or collapse. Key technical support lies around 5700, with resistance levels at 6150 and 6500. Over time, as geopolitical concerns ease, we could see implied volatility diminish.

This scenario suggests that oil markets may remain range-bound in the short term, with limited upside or downside unless a major geopolitical or supply-demand shock emerges.**

2024-11-13,"**US data update**

The dollar edged lower to 105.7 from a six month high of 106.2 earlier in the session after the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data met expectations. CPI rose by 0.2% month-over-month, pushing the annual inflation rate to 2.6%, a 0.2 percentage point increase from September, largely driven by a 0.4% mom and 4.9% yoy rise in the shelter index.

Core CPI also rose by 0.3% for the month, bringing the annual increase to 3.3%, in line with forecasts.

Despite the data, the dollar saw only limited downside, as inflation remains well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, which could complicate the central bank's monetary policy strategy going forward.

The CME FedWatch tool now shows a significant jump in expectations for a 25 basis point rate cut in December, rising to 76% from 59% the previous day. However, traders have reduced their rate cut bets following Donald Trump's election victory, fearing that his policies could add inflationary pressures. Currently, markets are pricing in a total of 75 basis points in rate cuts through the end of 2025, fewer rate cuts than before the election.

2024-11-14,"Key Observations:


Price Action:

Gold spot prices have decisively broken below the key uptrend support line (marked in blue) at around $2,605.
The breakdown signals a continuation of the bearish trend, with the next major support levels at $2,530 and $2,430-$2,470.


Momentum Indicators:

The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is at 21, indicating extremely oversold conditions. This suggests that while the bearish momentum is strong, a short-term technical bounce may be likely.

The moving average on RSI is trending at 40, confirming the overall bearish bias, but the divergence between RSI and its moving average hints at a stretched market condition.



Resistance Levels:

Immediate resistance lies at $2,605, which was previously the trendline support and now acts as resistance.

Further resistance levels are $2,650 and $2,700, should the price stage a recovery.


Support Levels:

First significant support is at $2,530.

A major support zone is at $2,430-$2,470. A break below this zone would likely trigger an acceleration in the downtrend.



Actionable Recommendations:

Short-Term Trading Strategy:

Short positions: Maintain existing shorts or consider new shorts on rallies toward $2,605, targeting $2,530 initially and $2,430-$2,470 if bearish momentum continues.

Stop-loss: Place stop-loss orders above $2,605 to manage risk.


Oversold Conditions Strategy:

Short-term bounce possibility: With the RSI at 21 (oversold), watch for signs of reversal near the $2,530 or $2,430-$2,470 support zones. A bounce back toward $2,605 or higher could occur before the next leg down.


Long-Term Positioning:

Wait for stabilization and confirmation of bullish divergence on RSI or price action before initiating long positions.


Risk Management:

Tighten risk parameters due to heightened volatility and potential for short-term bounces amid strong bearish momentum.


Outlook:

The downtrend in gold spot USD remains intact, with bearish momentum still dominant. However, oversold RSI levels increase the likelihood of a short-term technical bounce. A decisive break below $2,430 would confirm further downside, while a recovery above $2,605 would challenge the bearish bias and hint at consolidation.

2024-11-14,"Key Observations:


Price Action:

Silver spot prices are in a strong downtrend, currently trading near $30.09, just above the critical support level of $30.00.
The $31.20 level, a recent swing high, provides a potential stop-loss area for short sellers as the market approaches oversold conditions.
The next significant support lies at $29.00, aligning with the long-term upward-sloping trendline, which could attract buying interest.


Momentum Indicators:

The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is at 24, signaling extremely oversold conditions and increasing the potential for a short-term rebound.

The moving average of the RSI, currently at 36, continues to point downward, indicating sustained bearish momentum in the broader trend.


Resistance Levels:

Immediate resistance is located at $31.20, the recent swing high that serves as a logical stop-loss area for short sellers.

Further resistance lies at $32.00, which would need to be broken for any meaningful recovery in the trend.


Support Levels:

Immediate support is at $30.00, a critical psychological and technical level.

A break below $30.00 could lead to a test of $29.00, a key support aligning with the longer-term trendline.


Actionable Recommendations:


Short-Term Trading Strategy:


Short positions: Continue holding or initiating shorts below $31.20, targeting $30.00 initially and $29.00 if the bearish momentum persists.

Stop-loss: Place stop-loss orders above $31.20, the recent swing high, to manage risk effectively.


Oversold Conditions Strategy:


Monitor for a bounce: With RSI at 24, oversold conditions could lead to a short-term technical rebound near $30.00 or $29.00.

Consider scaling out of shorts or adjusting positions if price action shows signs of reversal at key support levels.



Long-Term Positioning:

Avoid long positions until silver prices exhibit stabilization and a sustained move above $31.20, supported by improving RSI trends.

Look for bullish divergences on the RSI or higher lows in price action as confirmation for initiating long trades.


Risk Management:

Tighten risk controls given the heightened volatility near key levels like $30.00 and $29.00.

Maintain disciplined stop-loss levels, especially during potential rebounds.


Outlook:

Silver spot prices remain in a strong downtrend, with the bearish bias intact. The $30.00 support is critical for short-term price action, and a break below this level could lead to further declines toward $29.00. While oversold RSI conditions suggest the possibility of a bounce, the overall trend will remain bearish unless $31.20, the recent swing high, is reclaimed.

2024-11-14,"Key Observations:


Price Action:


Crude oil futures in MCX are currently trading in a range-bound pattern, oscillating between key levels of ‚Çπ6,134 (upper resistance) and ‚Çπ5,650/‚Çπ5,660 (lower support).

The price has bounced twice from the long-term upward-sloping trendline, which indicates the importance of the ‚Çπ5,650/‚Çπ5,660 level as a significant support.

Short-term resistance levels are identified at ‚Çπ5,850 and ‚Çπ5,970, where selling pressure is evident.



Volume Profile Analysis (Left Histogram):


The anchored volume profile reveals heavy volumes traded around the ‚Çπ5,850 zone, suggesting this area as a key price acceptance level and potential resistance.

Lower traded volumes are seen near ‚Çπ5,650/‚Çπ5,660, aligning with previous price rebounds, making it a high-reward zone for buyers if tested again.



Support Levels:


Immediate support lies at ‚Çπ5,650/‚Çπ5,660, which coincides with the trendline support and previous bounce points.

A breakdown below ‚Çπ5,650 could accelerate selling, leading to a test of lower levels, likely around ‚Çπ5,500.



Resistance Levels:


Immediate resistance is seen at ‚Çπ5,850, where significant volumes and price rejections have occurred.

A stronger resistance level is observed at ‚Çπ5,970, which needs to be breached for the price to challenge the upper boundary at ‚Çπ6,134.


Momentum and Trend:

The market remains range-bound, with no decisive breakout in either direction.

The consistent bounces off the trendline suggest that the lower end of the range still has buyer interest, while resistance zones highlight short-selling opportunities.



Actionable Recommendations:


Positional Trading Strategy:


Long positions: Consider entering long trades on decline, targeting ‚Çπ5,970 as first target and 6100 as the extended target. Use a stop-loss below ‚Çπ5,630 to manage risk.


Short positions: If the price breaches ‚Çπ5,630, initiate short positions, targeting ‚Çπ5,500 with SL above 5710





Risk Management:


Maintain tight stops, given the range-bound nature of the market.

Monitor volume closely near key levels to confirm potential breakouts or reversals.



Outlook:

Crude oil MCX remains range-bound, with the anchored volume profile highlighting ‚Çπ5,850 as a key area of resistance and ‚Çπ5,650/‚Çπ5,660 as a significant support zone. A breakout above ‚Çπ5,970 or a breakdown below ‚Çπ5,650 will determine the next directional move. Until then, the market is likely to oscillate within the defined range, providing opportunities for both range-bound and breakout traders.

2024-11-14,"MCX Natural Gas futures are trading in an uptrend, currently near ‚Çπ250, but face significant selling pressure near ‚Çπ260, which acts as a major resistance zone. Short-term support is seen at ‚Çπ239, with ‚Çπ225 emerging as a critical level that has consistently attracted buyers. A break below ‚Çπ225 could invalidate the bullish trend and shift market sentiment to bearish. The anchored volume profile highlights heavy activity around ‚Çπ239, making it a pivotal level for determining the next directional move.

On the upside, a sustained breakout above ‚Çπ260 could open the path toward higher levels, potentially targeting ‚Çπ270. Conversely, a breakdown below ‚Çπ239 could lead to further downside pressure, with ‚Çπ225 as the next major support level. For now, the market appears range-bound between ‚Çπ239 and ‚Çπ260, with the trend intact as long as key supports hold.

From a fundamental perspective, mild weather conditions in much of the southern U.S. are keeping heating demand low, limiting upward momentum. However, traders are closely watching a potential cold system forecasted for the central and eastern U.S. between November 20-24, which could significantly boost heating demand. Conflicting weather models are adding uncertainty, with the GFS model projecting a more intense cold period than the European Center (EC) model. Should the EC model trend colder, prices may find additional support. Conversely, if the GFS model moderates, demand expectations might ease, potentially pressuring prices lower.

In conclusion, MCX Natural Gas futures remain in an uptrend but face immediate resistance near ‚Çπ260, with pivotal support levels at ‚Çπ239 and ‚Çπ225. Market direction will heavily depend on evolving weather patterns, which could introduce significant volatility in the coming weeks.

2024-11-14,"The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Producer Price Index (PPI) for final demand increased by 0.2% in October from the previous month, following a revised 0.1% rise in September, meeting expectations. On a year-over-year basis, headline wholesale inflation stood at 2.4%, driven largely by gains in services. Core PPI rose 0.3%, exceeding the September increase by one-tenth and also matching forecasts. The 12-month rate for core PPI was 3.1%. Consumer price data released on Wednesday also pointed to persistent inflation pressures.

Additionally, U.S. jobless claims fell to 217,000 last week, the lowest level since May, signaling a strong labor market.

Markets showed little reaction as this data did not alter expectations for a December rate cut and a slower easing pace through 2025. The dollar edged lower from a one-year high of 107, which helped gold recover from a two-month low of $2,541.50 per ounce.

The price is testing key support at ‚Çπ790, aligned with the upward-sloping trendline. A breakdown below this level could extend losses toward the ‚Çπ757-‚Çπ767 zone, a historically strong support range. The RSI is currently at 26.70, indicating deeply oversold conditions, which might trigger a short-term bounce. However, unless the price sustains above ‚Çπ790 and shows recovery, the broader trend remains bearish, reflecting weakening market sentiment and economic pressures. Traders who are short or looking to sell on rises are advised to maintain stop-losses above ‚Çπ810 and avoid trading without proper risk management, as markets can experience high volatility.
**

Fundamentally, copper prices are weighed down by concerns over China's slowing economic recovery, where recent stimulus measures have underwhelmed market expectations. A projected global copper surplus, driven by increased mine production, adds to the bearish outlook. Additionally, a strong US dollar has made copper costlier for non-dollar holders, curbing global demand. The looming threat of massive trade wars, particularly following a potential Trump sweep in the U.S., adds significant downside risks for copper. 

Any escalation in trade tensions could severely impact global trade and industrial activity, particularly in resource-heavy economies like China, further dampening copper demand. On the other hand, China's strategic push to substitute copper with aluminum and allow more private firms to blend complex copper concentrates domestically could stabilize supply and demand dynamics over time. Despite these potential offsets, macroeconomic headwinds, oversupply concerns, and geopolitical risks dominate the immediate outlook, keeping the bias bearish. The market direction will depend heavily on how these structural, policy, and geopolitical factors unfold in the coming months.

While the dollar remains below one-year highs, it has recovered from a session low of 106.33 following the data and is currently trading around 106.7. It is on track for its biggest weekly gain in a month, supported by expectations of fewer Fed rate cuts.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently indicated there is no immediate need to cut rates, noting that robust U.S. economic growth gives policymakers the flexibility to carefully consider the extent and pace of interest rate reductions. Powell also mentioned that while interest rates are expected to decline further, the pace of cuts may not be as rapid, due to continued economic growth, a solid labor market, and persistent inflation.

15-Nov-2024

Today, COMEX gold (December) is trading steadily above $2,573 per ounce, heading for its **worst weekly performance since June 2021**, pressured by a stronger US dollar and diminishing expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. 

A hawkish stance from the Fed has weighed on gold prices, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaling that there‚Äôs no immediate need to reduce rates, given the resilience of the US economy, a robust labor market, and persistent inflation pressures. 

Powell‚Äôs comments echoed sentiments from other Fed officials who support a cautious approach, reducing market confidence in a December rate cut of 25 bps, with the likelihood dropping to 60.8% from 82% prior to his remarks.

**On Thursday**, COMEX gold settled moderately lower near $2,573 per ounce, marking the fifth consecutive day of decline, though it recovered more than 1.2% from a fresh multi-week low of $2,541.50. 

US Treasury yields and the dollar eased after a brief surge in the dollar, which hit 107, its highest level since November 2022, before retreating. Investors are digesting Powell‚Äôs remarks alongside recent US economic data, as the Fed reaffirms its commitment to reaching a 2% inflation goal.

**US economic data delivered mixed signals**, with initial jobless claims falling to 217,000 for the week ending November 8, surpassing the forecasted 223,000. However, the October Producer Price Index (PPI) rose beyond expectations, amplifying inflation concerns. Wholesale inflation increased 0.2% m/m and 2.4% y/y, while the core annual PPI reached 3.1%, above both the 3% forecast and a revised 2.9%.

Investors now await today's US retail sales and the Empire State Manufacturing Index data for further insights into the economy‚Äôs trajectory.

2024-11-18,"Since mid-September, silver has consistently found strong support below the USD 30.00 level, suggesting the presence of substantial accumulation by strong hands. This makes the zone between USD 29.20 and 30.00 a significant accumulation area. On MCX, this range translates to INR 86,000 to 87,700.


**Key Levels for Silver:**

Support Zone: USD 29.20‚Äì30.00 (MCX INR 86,000‚Äì87,700)


Resistance Zones:

USD 31.20 (MCX INR 91,000)
USD 32.30 (MCX INR 94,000)



**Positional trading Strategy:**

Traders can finance their accumulation by selling out-of-the-money (OTM) call options with strikes above INR 94,000 on MCX, effectively converting the position into a covered call strategy.

Maintain a strict stop-loss (SL) below USD 29.20 on the spot market or around INR 85,700 on MCX to manage downside risk.

This strategy not only leverages the strong support zone for accumulation but also allows traders to enhance returns through option premium collection. Ensure disciplined risk management to navigate potential market volatility.

2024-11-18,"The US Dollar continues to surge as impressive economic data bolsters confidence in the US economy. Retail sales in October rose 0.4% month-on-month, slightly exceeding the consensus forecast of 0.3%. September's growth rate was also revised upward to 0.8% from 0.4%, further emphasizing economic resilience. Although industrial production fell by 0.3% in October, it outperformed market expectations of a 0.4% decline. The standout performer was the NY Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Index, which soared from -11.9 to an astonishing +31.2, far surpassing the consensus of 0.0.

This strong performance keeps the US Dollar robust and Treasury yields elevated. Over recent months, market expectations for the Federal Reserve's rate cuts have shifted significantly. Earlier, markets anticipated a reduction in the Fed rate from 4.75% to 2.75% by December 2024. Now, the expectation is that the Fed rate may only bottom out near 4%, reflecting a much tighter monetary policy outlook.

Key data to watch this week includes flash PMI surveys for manufacturing and services, which could provide further direction for the Dollar and yields.


**Gold Outlook:**

Gold has rebounded from oversold levels, bouncing off the critical support near USD 2530, previously identified as a potential downside target.

**Positional traders may consider long positions with a stop-loss below USD 2500 on the spot price or 73,000 on MCX. If gold falls below this level, it‚Äôs prudent to exit long positions.**

**On the upside, the USD 2620-2630 zone presents stiff resistance which is around 76,000 on MCX. A failure to break above this range may warrant a shift from long to short positions.

A decisive break above USD 2630 or 76,000 on MCX would confirm a potential bottom and signal the start of a new uptrend.**


**Trader's Strategy: **

Given the current environment, traders must remain agile. Monitor key levels closely and adapt positions swiftly to align with evolving market trends. A cautious approach with well-defined risk management is critical.

2024-11-19,"**MCX Crude Oil prices have consistently reversed from the strong support zone of 5500/5600 since early 2023, making this level a formidable bullish reversal area and a buyers' magnet. This zone appears to be strategically managed by strong hands in the global markets, with repeated reversals highlighting robust demand and bullish sentiment. The recent rebound from a false breakdown further reinforces its significance, as buyers have stepped in aggressively multiple times this year. Currently, prices are testing resistance near 5860, with potential to rise towards 5980/6000 and eventually 6150/6200 if momentum holds. 

Option sellers may find opportunities around this range as implied volatilities (IVs) have dipped, but a breakout from this controlled range is likely in the future, potentially driven by a major shift in global risk assets or geopolitical developments. If crude prices quickly rise to 6150/6200, aided by geopolitical triggers rather than supply-demand dynamics, IVs could expand sharply, signaling the emergence of a stronger trend beyond the current range**

Key support levels are identified near ‚Çπ240 and ‚Çπ250, attributed to the large put OI at these strikes.

2024-11-22,"**Silver Market Analysis**


**1. Technical Overview: Change in Polarity**

Chart Description: The first chart (weekly timeframe) highlights the significant level of $29.80/$30.00 in silver. This level, previously a resistance, has now turned into support. This is a classic example of the change in polarity principle in technical analysis.


Key Insights:

The price has successfully retested the $30.00 level, confirming it as a strong support zone.

The ascending trendline reflects a broader uptrend, signifying higher lows over time.
Silver's ability to hold above this level suggests a continuation of the bullish momentum, with the next significant resistance around $34.




**2. Building a Strong Base Below $30.00:**

Chart Description: The second chart (daily timeframe) provides a closer look at the $30.00 level acting as support. The price structure indicates a strong accumulation phase below $30.00.


Key Insights:

Buyers have defended the $30.00 level multiple times, indicating a high level of interest in this price zone.

The ascending trendline remains intact, reinforcing the bullish sentiment.

If silver maintains this base and breaks above the recent highs, it could retest the $34-$35 range.




**3. Intermarket Signals: Correlation with Gold and Copper**


Chart Description: The third chart compares the performance of silver, gold, and copper. While gold has shown strength, copper appears to lag.



**Key Insights:**

Gold-Silver Correlation: Gold‚Äôs upward momentum is a bullish signal for silver, given their historical positive correlation.

Copper's Divergence: Copper's weakness suggests a potential divergence in the industrial demand aspect of silver, which could limit upside potential in the short term.

Outlook: If gold continues its upward trend, silver is likely to follow, especially given its dual role as a precious and industrial metal. However, sustained weakness in copper might indicate caution for silver's industrial demand.




**Concluding Insights:**


**Bullish Scenario:**

Holding above the $29.50 level and breaking above $32 would confirm a strong uptrend.

Positive intermarket support from gold could drive silver higher toward $35 and beyond.



**Bearish Scenario:**

A sustained break below $29.50 would invalidate the current bullish structure, potentially leading to a drop toward $27 or lower.



**Intermarket Dynamics:**

Keep a close watch on gold's momentum and copper's performance for further clues on silver's direction.



**Positional Strategy:**

Accumulate on a price decline with stop-loss below $29.40. Target $34 and $35.

2024-11-25,"*India - Tariff Structure for import of Gold*

The *Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC)* declares gold tariffs every fortnight to ensure that the import duty on gold aligns with the fluctuating international gold prices. This frequent review and adjustment help in:

 *Fair Assessment of Import Duty*: By regularly updating the tariff value, the CBIC can accurately assess the import duty based on the current market price of gold. This prevents undervaluation or overvaluation of gold imports.
    
 *Revenue Generation*: Timely adjustments to the tariff value help the government in collecting appropriate import duties, contributing to overall revenue generation.

By implementing this fortnightly review mechanism, the CBIC aims to maintain a fair and transparent system for gold imports, while also protecting the interests of both the government and the industry.

**Gold Analysis**:

Gold prices remain in a bearish trend following a bearish divergence and subsequent breakdown, as seen in the chart. After the steep drop yesterday, we may witness some consolidation. Currently, the price is holding above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. While this level alone is not a strong support, the market appears to be treating it as a short-term level of interest, suggesting traders are watching it closely.

**
Key Levels to Watch:**


Support: The 61.8% Fibonacci level near $2606 is a short-term support, though not robust. A further decline toward the November 14th lows of $2536 on spot gold seems probable if bearish momentum persists.

Resistance: Initial resistance is near $2650, followed by a stronger zone around $2675.

Bias: The overall bias remains bearish. Consolidation at these levels might provide opportunities for reentry into the downtrend.

2024-11-26,"**Silver Analysis: Approaching a Major Support Cluster**


Silver is trading near a critical support cluster. If the price breaks below $29.30, it could lead to a major breakdown of both the trendline and the previous resistance-turned-support zone (role-reversal level). In this scenario, prices may target $27.70 as intermediate support, and eventually drop toward $26.60 or even lower levels.

Conversely, a move above $31.50 would shift the trend upward, signaling a potential resumption of bullish momentum. Traders aiming to accumulate silver on dips could consider maintaining a stop-loss (SL) below $29.20 on a USD basis.


**
Key Levels to Watch:**

Support: $29.30 (critical), $27.70 (intermediate), $26.60 (major).

Resistance: $31.50 (bullish breakout zone).

Takeaway: Above $31.50, traders can expect strong bullish momentum, while a breakdown below $29.30 could invite significant downside pressure. Adjust positions accordingly to manage risk and capture opportunities.

Accumulating in tranches helps manage risk more effectively, and a strong risk management approach is to convert long futures into covered calls by selling out-of-the-money call options with strike prices above ‚Çπ93,500. 

This strategy is aligned with the fact that the resistance level around $31.50 on spot, or ‚Çπ94,000 on MCX, serves as a crucial zone for a potential trend reversal from bearish to bullish.It is also essential to maintain a stop loss below ‚Çπ87,000 on MCX or $29.20 on spot to limit downside risk.

**Gold: **

A rough rule of thumb for translating prices from USD per ounce to MCX is that for every $1 move in spot gold, the MCX gold price may move approximately 27 rupees per 10 grams if it follows the global price movement closely.



**Silver:**

Similarly, for silver, every 1 cent move in spot silver could translate to a 27 rupees per kg change in the MCX silver price if the prices follow the movement in the international market accurately.

2024-12-04,"**""The Great Reset: Navigating De-Dollarisation and the Dawn of a Multipolar World""**



**What is Dollarisation?**

Dollarisation refers to the global economic phenomenon where the U.S. dollar serves as the dominant currency for trade, reserves, and savings, extending far beyond the United States. For dollarization to succeed, the U.S. had to decouple the dollar from gold in the 1970s and instead peg key commodities, especially energy, to the dollar. This shift provided the U.S. with unparalleled fiscal leverage, effectively creating a limitless credit card to finance its economy.


________________________________________

**The Mechanics of Dollarisation**

1. Unlimited Fiscal Leverage:

In a fiat currency system, money is debt. The U.S. expanded its fiscal deficit to increase the base money supply, which allowed the Federal Reserve to print dollars. Private financial institutions then further expanded the money supply by leveraging the base money, creating a massive global dollar supply.


2. Economic Advantage:

This system enabled U.S. businesses, the government, and financial institutions to ""print prosperity,"" while the rest of the world had to earn it.


3.Petrodollar System:

The U.S. dollar's dominance was reinforced by pegging oil and other commodities to it. West Asia played a critical role by accepting dollars for oil, giving the currency intrinsic value and cementing its role in global trade.


________________________________________

**De-Dollarization in Motion**


De-dollarization‚Äîthe process of reducing dependence on the dollar‚Äîhas been quietly unfolding for over a decade, driven by global economic shifts and rising U.S. debt levels. Key players in this transition include:

1. BRICS+ Nations:

Actively pursuing de-dollarization, BRICS+ countries are accumulating significant gold and silver reserves. While official channels are reported, unreportable methods such as domestic gold production, sovereign wealth funds, unallocated bullion accounts, private dealers, and bilateral agreements are likely being used. This diversification strengthens their financial sovereignty.


2. West Asia:
As the global economy pivots away from oil, the relevance of the petrodollar system is diminishing. West Asia is exploring alternatives, diversifying trade and currency holdings.


3. China:
China‚Äôs dollarized export-driven model has reached its limits. Faced with low birth rates, aging populations, weak consumption, and unserviceable debt, China is transitioning away from the dollar, despite the economic pains of this shift.


4. Russia:
Russia‚Äôs long-term strategy of reducing dependence on the dollar and SWIFT has enabled it to lead the de-dollarization movement effectively.


5. Gold and Dollar Rising Together:
The simultaneous rise of gold and the U.S. dollar in recent years reflects the complexities of this transition. Traditional reserve assets like gold are gaining traction, while emerging ones like Bitcoin are introducing new dynamics to global markets.


________________________________________

**The Future of the Dollar**

A multi-currency world is emerging, where the U.S. dollar will likely become part of a broader basket of reserve currencies, potentially backed by bullion and real assets, and integrated into digitized systems.


________________________________________

**Short-Term Dollar Strength and Long-Term Weakness**

If Donald Trump pursues fiscal restraint, manufacturing revival, and economic realignment, the global economy could experience:

1. Short-Term Strength:
The U.S. dollar may strengthen during the first 6-9 months of 2025, driven by market chaos from de-dollarization and decoupling.


2. Eventual Weakness:
To support domestic manufacturing, the U.S. would need to significantly devalue the dollar by late 2025 or early 2026. This process could involve:
__
o High inflation
o Wage adjustments
o Increased resource exploitation__

These measures would reduce production costs and enhance the affordability of U.S.-made goods but could trigger severe market volatility.

2024-12-12,"Gold snapped a four-day advance as investors looked beyond the prospect of a US interest-rate cut next week to a more uncertain outlook for the coming year.

US consumer price data on Wednesday rose in line with expectations, bolstering bets for a 25-basis-point rate cut when the Federal Reserve meets next week. But the trajectory of monetary policy in 2025 remains highly uncertain as the world braces for Donald Trump‚Äôs return to the White House.

‚ÄúMarkets are pricing in a potential Fed pause in January 2025 and the risk of a slower pace of Fed cuts going forward,‚Äù said Christopher Wong, FX strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. 

Lower borrowing costs typically aid non-yielding bullion.Bullion fell as much as 0.7% to trade near $2,700 an ounce, after gaining more than 3% over the previous three sessions.

Gold is on track for its biggest annual gain since 1979, with support from Fed easing, haven demand, and sustained buying by the world‚Äôs central banks. China reported that it resumed buying for its reserves in November after a six-month pause, buoying prices that had retreated in the wake of Trump‚Äôs election victory.

Traders were also monitoring adislocation between the New York and London markets for gold and silver, with premiums for futures contracts jumping on Wednesday. The possibility of precious metals being subject to US import tariffs under the Trump administration has triggered the divergence, analysts said.

Gold for immediate delivery was down 0.2% to $2,711.89 an ounce at 12:19 p.m. in London, following a 0.9% gain on Wednesday. The commodity‚Äôs latest record was set at the end of October, with prices peaking just above $2,790.

2024-12-16,"**Technical View on MCX Crude Oil:**

Crude oil prices are witnessing volatility compression within a range of 5600 to 6200, as traders await a decisive breakout or breakdown. Key support lies at 5640/50, while 6060 acts as an interim resistance ahead of the major hurdle at 6150/6180. A sustained move above 6180 could trigger a bullish breakout, opening upside potential towards 6400 levels. Conversely, a breach below 5640 would confirm bearish dominance, setting the stage for a decline towards 5500 or lower.

Option Strategy:

Range-Bound Scenario (Between 5640 and 6180): Traders can implement a Short Strangle by selling the 6200 CE and 5600 PE to take advantage of time decay in a low-volatility environment. Strict risk management is essential if prices break above 6180 or fall below 5640. Traders with ultra-low brokerage costs can consider converting the Short Strangle into a Short Iron Fly by buying further out-of-the-money (OTM) options. This adjustment transforms the strategy into a hedged position with limited risk, mitigating the unlimited downside risk inherent in a Short Strangle. Additionally, the margin requirement drops significantly for a Short Iron Fly compared to a traditional Short Strangle.

For a detailed explanation and weekly backtested short strangle strategy insights, please refer to our analysis shared via email, WAP, and Telegram over the weekend.

2024-12-16,"Natural Gas prices are trading within an upward channel, but a bearish divergence on the RSI suggests caution in the near term. Bulls need to defend the critical 264/265 support to keep the broader bullish trend intact. A breakdown below this level could trigger further declines towards the next supports at 250 and 225, which align with the lower boundary of the ascending channel. On the upside, 300 remains a strong resistance, with a breakout above this level necessary to resume the bullish momentum.

Traders should closely monitor price action near 265. A sustained move below 264 could shift the sentiment bearish, while a bounce from this support can attract fresh buying, keeping the trend alive. Additionally, RSI bearish divergence indicates weakening momentum, which warrants a cautious approach for bullish trades unless 265 is strongly defended.

2024-12-16,"**Summary of the Analysis:**


The table provides a detailed breakdown of performance metrics across various combinations of strike distances and days to expiry. These insights are derived using two critical variables:


Average True Range (ATR): A measure of market volatility used to calculate strike distances.

Days to Expiry (DTE): The remaining time until the option contract expires.


**
Key Findings:**

From our analysis, the following patterns emerged as consistent and actionable:


Optimal Strike Distance:

A strike distance of 2.0‚Äì2.5 times ATR from the ATM (at-the-money) strike is ideal. This range balances risk and reward by capturing a significant portion of market moves while maintaining manageable losses during adverse scenarios.



Optimal Time to Expiry (DTE):

Trades executed with a minimum of 10 days and a maximum of 25 days to expiry tend to perform best. Shorter durations often result in insufficient time to capture profits, while longer durations may increase exposure to adverse price movements.



**Performance Metrics (Rupees per Barrel):**

Median Profit: Represents typical returns per trade.

Worst Profit: Highlights the maximum drawdown observed in adverse market conditions, helping you assess potential downside risks.

Best Profit: Shows the maximum profitability under favorable market conditions.

Composite Score: A weighted metric combining profitability, risk, and trade consistency to rank the best strategies.



**Word of Caution:**

Shorting strangles in crude oil options, particularly in the MCX (Multi Commodity Exchange), comes with its own set of risks:

High Volatility: Crude oil is among the most volatile commodities, heavily influenced by geopolitical events, supply-demand imbalances, and macroeconomic factors.


Sudden Price Surges: Unexpected news events, such as OPEC decisions, U.S. inventory reports, or geopolitical crises, can lead to extreme price movements, causing significant mark-to-market losses in short option positions.


Unlimited Risk: Short strangles carry theoretically unlimited risk if the underlying crude oil prices move significantly in either direction. Proper margin management and risk hedging strategies are essential.


Regulatory Factors: MCX contracts have specific margin requirements and trading rules. It is important to stay updated on any regulatory changes that may impact your positions.


**Practical Implications for Trading:**

Refined Strike Selection: Use 2.0‚Äì2.5 times ATR as a benchmark for setting strike prices.

Focused Timing: Concentrate on trades with 10‚Äì25 days to expiry to optimize profitability and reduce exposure to prolonged market risks.

Proactive Risk Management: Employ stop-loss levels and monitor key market events (e.g., OPEC meetings, inventory data releases) to avoid large drawdowns.

Hedging Strategies: Consider hedging directional risks by incorporating complementary positions (e.g., futures or protective options).

2024-12-16,"**What This Analysis Is About?**


This study simulates a short strangle strategy in MCX Natural Gas options, where the strike prices are selected based on the prevailing Average True Range (ATR). ATR is a measure of realized volatility, indicating how much the price of Natural Gas typically fluctuates.



**How It Works:**


Strike Selection Based on ATR:

When volatility (ATR) is high, strike prices are selected further away from the underlying price to mitigate risk.

When volatility is low, strikes are placed closer to the underlying price to collect higher premiums.



Simulation:

The strategy was simulated for each ATR multiplier category, starting with 30 days to expiry and reducing incrementally to 1 day to expiry.


The goal was to find combinations of ATR multipliers and days to expiry that yield the best profitability and risk control.
Top Performers:



The table highlights the top 3 combinations from each ATR category based on a composite score that factors in:


Profitability (Average Profit, % Profitable Trades)

Risk (Worst Loss)



Key Recommendations

Based on the simulation results:

ATR Multiplier: 1.5 to 2.0

Days to Expiry: 25‚Äì30 days



This combination strikes a good balance between:

Profitability: High average profits and % profitable trades.

Risk Control: Manageable worst-case losses and fewer extreme price movements.




**Risks to Consider**

High Volatility:

Natural Gas options have Implied Volatilities (IVs) ranging from 60‚Äì120%, making them prone to sharp price swings.



Gamma Risk:

Near expiry, gamma sensitivity increases significantly, and small price movements can lead to large changes in option premiums, causing substantial losses.



Overnight Gaps:

As a globally traded commodity, Natural Gas is highly sensitive to:

Weather patterns, geopolitical events, and inventory reports.

This can cause massive price gaps overnight, leading to sudden losses for short option positions.

2024-12-16,"**Technical View and Trading Recommendation:**

Silver Spot USD and MCX Silver Futures are delicately poised at key support levels. On the Spot market, the $30.00 support aligns closely with the interim support of 89,800 on the MCX chart. This level must hold for bullish hopes to remain intact. A breakdown below $30.00 could trigger a retest of the next major support at $29.60 (MCX equivalent: 88,000), which is critical for the broader uptrend. Meanwhile, resistance at $32.35 (MCX: 96,500) remains a key hurdle for further upside momentum.


**Positional Traders:**

Long Entry: Around $30.00 (Spot) / 89,800 (MCX) levels.

Stop Loss: Below $29.50 (Spot) / 87,800 (MCX) to protect against further downside.

Target: First resistance at $32.35 (Spot) / 96,500 (MCX).

Weak momentum indicated by RSI suggests caution, but as long as support holds, a recovery towards resistance remains probable. Traders can consider a positional long strategy with strict stop loss adherence.

2024-12-16,"**Technical View on Gold:**

Gold Spot USD is consolidating, with $2600/2615 acting as a critical support level, aligning with 75,200 on MCX Gold Futures. Bulls maintain control as long as prices hold above these levels. The rising trendline and previous price action suggest buyers may step in near these supports. A sustained move above $2720 (or 76,200 on MCX) would confirm further upside potential.

**Positional View**:

Positional traders can go long on dips near $2600/2615 (or 75,200-76,200 on MCX) with a stop loss at $2590 (75,000 on MCX). Upside targets remain at $2720 (77,500-78,000 on MCX) and beyond if momentum strengthens. Maintain a bullish bias as long as the key support holds.

2024-12-16,"Copper futures remain in a downtrend, as indicated by the consistent lower highs and lower lows within a descending channel. Immediate support lies at 804, with a further critical support zone at 794/796. A breach below 794 could trigger accelerated selling pressure, potentially pushing prices toward lower levels. On the upside, 845/846 serves as the key resistance level, aligning with the descending trendline, which must be decisively breached for any reversal signal to emerge.

Traders should watch for price action near 804. If this support holds, a short-term bounce may occur; however, any failure to sustain above 804 would confirm continued bearish momentum. A breakdown below 794 will validate further downside risk, while a reversal above 845/846 would challenge the existing downtrend. Until then, the bearish bias remains intact.

2024-12-17,"Risk appetite remains subdued as traders digest strong retail sales data for November while awaiting the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates and its economic projections. US Retail sales surged by 0.7% in November, building on an upwardly revised 0.5% increase in October, according to the Commerce Department‚Äôs Census Bureau. The year-on-year growth for November reached 3.8%, surpassing expectations. A significant contributor to this robust performance was a 2.6% jump in sales at auto dealerships, likely fueled by consumers replacing vehicles damaged by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Additionally, online retail sales rose by 1.8%, underscoring the ongoing shift toward digital shopping.

November's data highlights consumer resilience, particularly during the critical holiday shopping season. However, despite the strong retail performance, it is unlikely to alter expectations for a quarter-point rate cut in December. 

However, uncertainty remains for the months ahead. While the US economy continues to show resilience, concerns about potential inflationary pressures from import tariffs, potentially imposed by the incoming administration of Donald Trump, could lead the Fed to reconsider the pace of future interest rate moves. Owing to this, dollar holds steady near 107 levels while commodities witnessed a decline in the range of 0.8% - 1.5%.

The Fed faces difficulty easing monetary policy as U.S. fiscal spending remains high, consumer demand strong, and inflation pressures mount. With Trump‚Äôs potential tariffs next year likely to further fuel inflation, the Fed revised its terminal rate cut projection from 100 to 50 basis points, signaling caution. Cutting rates while at 4% echoes the 1970s, a period of extreme volatility.

Market Impact

As anticipated, volatility is set to dominate 2025-26, with Trump‚Äôs trade policies potentially disrupting global trade and fueling inflation. Bullion is under pressure‚Äîsilver at $29.45 and gold relatively better off‚Äîwhile a stronger dollar and higher U.S. bond yields add to commodity headwinds.

Key Takeaway

Expect heightened volatility and challenging policymaking, with commodities likely facing near-term turbulence

2024-12-20,"COMEX Gold futures extended gains on Friday, rising 1.5% to over  $2,653 per ounce as a softer dollar and declining Treasury yields after U.S. economic data indicated a slowdown in inflation provided support. 

U.S. economic data indicated a slowdown in inflation, with the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index rising just 0.1% in November, following an unrevised 0.2% increase in October. The weaker-than-expected personal income and spending data further suggested a softening economic landscape, prompting some investors to re-enter the gold market and rebuild positions.

The dollar index fell 0.5% from its two-year high, making gold more affordable for overseas buyers, while 10-year Treasury yields retreated from their six-month peak. However, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs ""dot plot"" signaled only two 25-basis-point rate cuts by 2025, tempering hopes for aggressive monetary easing.

 Meanwhile, COMEX silver also jumped 1.7% to trade near $29.9 per ounce but headed for its worst weekly performance since July 2024, reflecting broader pressure on precious metals amid shifting rate expectations.

**COMEX Gold futures edged moderately higher to settle above $2,635 per ounce in subdued holiday trading on Tuesday**, as investors turned their focus to the Federal Reserve's 2025 rate strategy and President-elect Donald Trump's forthcoming tariff policies.

Following aggressive rate cuts earlier in 2024, the Fed signaled a more measured approach for 2025, despite continuing its easing cycle in December.

Central bank buying, monetary policy shifts, and geopolitical tensions have driven gold to record highs, culminating in a 27% annual surge‚Äîthe metal‚Äôs strongest performance since 2010.

A softer U.S. inflation reading last week tempered fears of aggressive rate cuts next year, with markets now anticipating a modest 35-basis-point reduction in 2025. Meanwhile, Trump‚Äôs return to the White House is expected to bring sweeping changes to tariffs, deregulation, and tax policy, potentially unsettling markets.

Should geopolitical tensions escalate under the new administration, gold‚Äôs safe-haven appeal may further strengthen, positioning bullion for another stellar year despite the headwinds posed by higher interest rates.

The plans would pare back a pledge made on the campaign trail to apply tariffs on all goods imported into the US, the paper reported, citing three unidentified people familiar with
the matter.¬†

The threat of so-called universal tariffs has weighed heavily on metals markets, with analysts warning that the measures could fuel inflation in the US and exacerbate a slowdown in China‚Äôs industrial economy. Instead, aides are discussing targeted tariffs in sectors where Trump is seeking to boost domestic production, including defense, medical supplies and energy, the paper said.¬†

Hence silver outperforming gold",telegram,negative,0.739143431186676,-0.35345765948295593,-0.35345765948295593,-0.7069153,0.0,0.0,1.0,0,1
2025-01-07,"The Gold/Silver ratio is a powerful tool to understand the relationship between the prices of gold and silver. Over time, this ratio has shown different patterns of behavior, shifting between strong trends and range-bound movements. These changes are influenced by macroeconomic factors, such as inflation, interest rates, and industrial demand for silver.

**
###  Changing Behavior of the Ratio**


Historically, the ratio has alternated between periods of strong uptrends, downtrends, and sideways movements. In the past, there have been phases where the ratio exhibited a clear upward or downward trend. For example, during economic uncertainty or deflationary environments, gold tends to outperform silver, leading to an upward trend in the ratio. Conversely, in inflationary periods or when industrial demand for silver is high, silver often outperforms gold, pushing the ratio lower.


Since the end of 2022, the ratio has been range-bound, oscillating between the upper band (92) and the lower band (78), with a mean around 85. This indicates that neither gold nor silver has consistently outperformed the other during this period, creating opportunities for mean-reversion trading.


Understanding these shifts is essential for traders because they determine the most effective trading strategy. In trending periods, riding the trend might be more profitable, while in range-bound phases, mean-reversion strategies tend to work better.




### **How to Trade the Current Range-Bound Behavior Using MCX Futures**


The current range-bound movement provides clear reversion levels for traders:


1. At the Upper Band (Around 92):

   - When the ratio approaches the upper band, it suggests that gold is relatively expensive compared to silver.

   - Trade Idea: Sell Gold Futures on MCX and Buy Silver Futures on MCX. Profit if the ratio moves back toward the mean (85).


2. At the Lower Band (Around 78):

   - When the ratio nears the lower band, silver is relatively expensive compared to gold.

   - Trade Idea: Buy Gold Futures on MCX and Sell Silver Futures on MCX. Profit as the ratio reverts toward the mean.


3. Current Situation (Ratio ~87.8):

   - The ratio is closer to the upper band, suggesting gold has outperformed silver recently. However, since it‚Äôs not yet at extreme levels, traders may wait for the ratio to get closer to 92 before initiating a sell-gold/buy-silver trade or watch for early signs of a reversal toward 85.



### **Key Points to Keep in Mind**


- Standard Deviation Bands: The ratio tends to revert to the mean from the upper (+2 SD) and lower (-2 SD) bands. These bands act as boundaries, defining when gold or silver may be overvalued.

- Drift and Behavior Changes: Over time, the mean and bands can shift due to changes in market dynamics, like monetary policy, inflation, or industrial demand. For example, the slight upward drift in the ratio since 2022 indicates that gold has gradually strengthened relative to silver, even within a range.

- Risk Management: Use stop-loss orders and ensure proper position sizing. Since silver futures on MCX are smaller in contract value than gold futures, adjust the number of lots accordingly to balance the trade.



### **Conclusion**


The Gold/Silver ratio has historically shown changing behavior, alternating between trending and range-bound phases. Since late 2022, the ratio has been oscillating within a defined range, providing opportunities for mean-reversion strategies. Using MCX futures, retail traders can efficiently capitalize on these movements by buying or selling gold and silver futures at key reversion levels. Understanding the ratio‚Äôs dynamic nature and adapting strategies to its changing behavior is crucial for long-term success in trading precious metals.

2025-01-07,"The MCX Natural Gas chart highlights a significant breakout after a prolonged year-long consolidation, confirming a bullish shift in sentiment. The breakout above the key resistance level near 250 has laid the groundwork for higher potential targets, supported by an ascending trendline. This breakout suggests sustained upward momentum, but its continuation will depend on the interplay between technical and fundamental factors.

On the fundamental front, the harsh US winter caused by La Ni√±a conditions has fueled bullish sentiment, with cold temperatures expected to persist. Across the Atlantic, Europe faces record withdrawals from gas storage due to winter demand, compounded by Russia halting gas flows to the EU via Ukraine, raising the risk of tighter supplies. This has driven the EU to rely more on US gas imports. Additionally, upcoming US liquefaction capacity expansions are supporting export growth, further boosting sentiment in the US gas market. However, traders should not overlook the bearish risk posed by US inventory levels, which remain above the five-year average. With policies under Trump encouraging drilling and exports, supplies could increase in the coming quarters. Despite this, market participants are presently focused on the bullish catalysts, sidelining potential supply-side risks.

**
 Price Action and Trade Strategy**

**The immediate support levels are 280 and 260, with 260 being critical for maintaining the bullish structure. **Any dips toward these levels are considered a buying opportunity for positional traders, provided prices hold above 260. Positional traders should maintain stop-losses below 260 to protect against downside risks. Given the potential for sharp overnight gaps, futures positions should be avoided in favor of options strategies like call spreads to manage risk effectively.

On the upside, natural gas prices hold significant potential for higher targets, but traders must stay cautious and monitor fundamental developments closely. If prices fail to hold above 260, the breakout may prove to be false, potentially leading to consolidation or a bearish reversal. With increased volatility expected as prices move higher, a careful, measured approach is essential for trading this market.

2025-01-07,"**The MCX Zinc chart indicates a near-term downward trend, with prices steadily declining and now approaching a strong support zone near 269/270. This level has acted as a critical support in the past and could potentially halt the current downtrend, offering a possible reversal or consolidation. The price action reflects a clear respect for this zone, making it a pivotal area to watch closely.

From a momentum perspective, the RSI is approaching oversold territory, which suggests that selling pressure may be nearing exhaustion. This increases the likelihood of a technical rebound or stabilization near the support zone. However, the overall structure still favors caution, as the broader trend remains bearish. If 269/270 holds, it could provide an opportunity for a short-term bounce, with potential targets around 278 and 283, aligning with previous resistance levels.

Traders looking for long opportunities should wait for confirmation of support holding near 269/270 and use tight stop-loss levels below 268 to manage risk. On the flip side, if prices breach the 269 level decisively, it could lead to further downside, potentially targeting lower levels around 260. Monitoring momentum indicators and price behavior around this critical support zone is essential to confirm the next directional move.**

2025-01-07,"**Silver has a short-term bullish outlook as prices have broken out of the recent consolidation zone between 28.70 and 29.75. This breakout opens up a potential target of 31.15/20, a critical confluence zone where the falling trendline resistance intersects with a previous support-turned-resistance level, making it a formidable area of resistance. The breakout indicates strength, but the 31.15/20 level will likely test the sustainability of the upward momentum.

For traders considering long positions in Silver, it is crucial to maintain a stop-loss below USD 29.35. A return below this level would invalidate the bullish setup and increase the risk of the downtrend resuming, potentially driving prices back toward the lower end of the previous consolidation zone near 28.70. This setup offers a defined risk-reward opportunity but requires close monitoring of price action around the resistance zone.**

2025-01-07,"The MCX Copper chart is currently in a consolidation phase, with prices forming a solid base below the 800 level, setting the stage for a potential bullish breakout. The ascending trendline, repeatedly tested near the 793/795 zone, highlights its importance as a critical support level. The flatter slope of the trendline reinforces its robustness; however, a breach below this level could indicate a shift in market sentiment and a possible downside trend reversal.

Copper is approaching resistance at 820, which is a pivotal level. A breakout above this resistance could unlock the path to the next significant resistance around 845, aligning with the falling trendline and providing a key upside target. Momentum indicators, including the RSI, are coiling, signaling potential for a strong directional move. With the RSI below overbought levels, there remains room for additional upside if 820 is decisively broken.

**For positional traders, buying on dips near the 800/805 zone offers a favorable risk-reward setup, with a stop-loss placed below 790 to protect against downside risks. **Careful observation of price action and momentum indicators is crucial to confirm the breakout or identify signs of a continuation of consolidation or a reversal. This setup presents an opportunity, but disciplined risk management is essential.

2025-01-07,"**The MCX Crude Oil chart displays strong bullish momentum, with prices breaking above the 6150 resistance and nearing the critical confluence zone of 6500/6525. This area, defined by a long-term descending trendline and a significant prior price action zone, serves as a formidable resistance. The breakout above 6150 confirms bullish continuation; however, the RSI indicates overbought conditions, suggesting the possibility of a near-term pullback or consolidation before further advances.


Traders should be cautious as prices approach the 6525 level, where selling pressure is likely to emerge. Chasing the current trend poses unfavorable risk-reward dynamics for positional longs. The optimal trade setup was when prices broke out above 6000, providing a strong long opportunity. At current levels, sticking to intraday long positions is a safer strategy. A pullback into the 6050/6150 zone would present a better entry point for fresh longs, with a stop-loss below 6000. For traders considering contra short positions, options strategies like put spreads are advised to manage risk while capitalizing on potential reversals from the resistance zone.**

2025-01-07,"**The MCX Aluminum chart shows a well-defined range-bound movement, with prices fluctuating between the support zone at 230/232 and the resistance zone near 244.55/247.60. The support level at 230/232 has acted as a strong base, consistently preventing further downside as buyers step in. Meanwhile, the resistance zone at 244.55/247.60 has seen repeated selling pressure, confirming it as a key level of overhead supply. This consolidation phase suggests the absence of a dominant trend, making it an ideal setup for range-based trading strategies.

Within this range, traders can consider going long near the 230/232 support level with a stop-loss below 228, targeting the resistance levels at 244 and 247. Similarly, short positions can be initiated near the resistance zone at 244.55/247.60, with a stop-loss above 250 and a target back toward 232. If prices break above 247.60, it could signal the start of a bullish breakout toward higher levels, while a breakdown below 230 would open the door for potential downside. Until such a decisive move occurs, this range provides favorable opportunities for disciplined trading within its boundaries.**

2025-01-07,"*China‚Äôs Central Bank Buys More Gold as Prices Trade Near Record*

 China‚Äôs central bank expanded its gold reserves for a second month in December, signaling renewed appetite after temporarily pausing purchases last year as prices soared.

Bullion held by the People‚Äôs Bank of China rose to 73.29 million fine troy ounces in December, from 72.96 million in the previous month, according to data released Tuesday. The central bank resumed adding to its gold reserves in November after a 6- month pause.

The purchase shows the PBOC is still keen to diversify its reserves even with gold at historically expensive levels. The metal‚Äôs rally to a record in 2024 was supported by monetary easing in the US, safe-haven demand, and sustained buying by global central banks. 

Still, the rally cooled after Donald Trump‚Äôs US election victory buoyed the dollar. Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. pushed back a forecast for when gold was seen hitting $3,000 an ounce, citing the expectation of fewer rate cuts by the Fed in 2025.

2025-01-07,"**The price action of the Gold Spot USD chart highlights a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating price consolidation with a narrowing range. Key resistance levels are noted at 2685 and 2720, with immediate support at 2600 and critical long-term support around 2500, aligned with the ascending trendline since late 2023. This trendline reinforces the bullish sentiment in the long-term trend, even as short-term price action consolidates. The resistance at 2685 reflects recent highs, while 2720 represents a stronger hurdle from prior rallies. On the support side, 2600 is a key level, with 2500 providing a robust foundation, as it aligns with the broader bullish trendline.



A breakout above 2720 could signal renewed bullish momentum, potentially driving prices toward 2800 or beyond. Conversely, a breach of 2600 could pressure gold toward the 2500 zone, where the trendline support would be tested. A decisive break below 2500 might indicate a bearish reversal. Positional traders looking to go long are advised to consider building positions near current levels but should maintain a strict stop-loss below the 2580 mark to protect against downside risks. This setup demands close monitoring, as the approaching apex of the triangle pattern suggests an imminent breakaway from the consolidation.**

In 2024, Gold ETFs recording the first annual inflow since 2019, driven by heightened geopolitical uncertainties, central banks' easing cycles, and record-breaking gold prices. 

Total assets under management (AUM) surged by 26% to an all-time high of US$271bn, despite a marginal 0.2% decline in collective holdings. A net inflow of US$3.4bn across global physically backed gold ETFs underscored growing investor interest, especially in Asia, with North American funds posting their first positive flow since 2020 and European outflows narrowing significantly compared to 2023.

In December 2024, global gold ETFs reversed their trend with inflows of US$778mn, marking the first positive December since 2019. 

Asia and Europe led this recovery, while North America saw mild outflows. Global holdings rose by 4 tonnes to 3,219 tonnes, although AUM dipped by 1.4% due to a 1.5% decline in gold prices.

Overall, 2024 marked a remarkable year for gold, with a 39% increase in trading volumes and the strongest annual price performance since 2010, setting new all-time highs 40 times during the year.

2025-01-13,"**Crude oil continues to display its classic cascading breakout formations, where the target of one breakout triggers another larger pattern, amplifying the price movement. Recently, we witnessed consecutive double-bottom breakouts at 6,000, 6,140, and finally at 6,500, indicating a strong upward trend. While momentum remains robust, overbought conditions suggest the possibility of a short-term pullback or consolidation. The 6,450‚Äì6,500 zone is expected to act as a strong support level, making it an attractive area for positional traders to consider buying, with a stop-loss below 6,400.

On the upside, the immediate target remains 7,000, with the potential for prices to reach 7,400 if the bullish momentum sustains. However, traders should remain cautious, as a decisive break below 6,400 would negate the bullish outlook and signal a possible reversal. With geopolitical and macroeconomic factors often influencing oil, this setup is worth closely monitoring for further developments.**

2025-01-13,"**We need to remain vigilant for potential margin-call-driven selling during the upcoming US session.

Global markets are intricately interconnected. The relentless rise in the US Dollar and interest rates could be intensifying losses for institutions and retail investors globally. In such scenarios, margin calls can cascade across asset classes, forcing traders to liquidate positions based on liquidity rather than preference‚Äîselling what they can, not necessarily what they want.

This dynamic makes commodities, particularly gold and silver, highly susceptible to sudden selling pressure. However, such phenomena can also present opportunities for investors to accumulate gold and silver at more attractive levels.

It is equally important to keep leverage under control and avoid over-leveraging, which can magnify risks during volatile market conditions.

Stay alert, stay prepared, and stay informed.** üí•üí•üí•

2025-01-14,"Silver's recent rally was capped by the descending trendline resistance near ‚Çπ94,200, with the strong US Dollar index rally driving prices lower. The current retracement has brought Silver closer to a key support zone around ‚Çπ90,000.

We view the region below ‚Çπ90,000, particularly between ‚Çπ88,900-‚Çπ89,500, as a strong accumulation zone. This area has historically seen traders getting trapped during earlier sell-offs, followed by a short squeeze. The memory of these painful losses can encourage fresh buying at these levels.

**Trading Strategy:**

Buyers: Positional traders may consider accumulating within this zone for potential upside opportunities.

Resistance Levels: Initial resistance is expected near ‚Çπ91,000-‚Çπ91,300, where previous buyers were trapped in the recent downtrend. A sustained breakout above this range could open doors to ‚Çπ94,000, coinciding with the descending trendline.

Resistance Levels: Upside resistance is marked at ‚Çπ78,800 and ‚Çπ79,200, which may act as barriers to further gains.

Positional View: The broader outlook remains bullish as long as prices hold above the key support levels. A breakout above ‚Çπ78,800 could accelerate momentum, potentially pushing prices toward higher levels.

2025-01-16,"**The comparative implied volatility (IV) curves for crude oil options highlight evolving market sentiments over time. In October 2024, IV was significantly higher across all strikes, reflecting heightened market uncertainty or risk events, which likely drove up option premiums. By December 2024, IV decreased noticeably, suggesting a period of stabilization or resolution of earlier concerns. 

However, the January 2025 IV curve shows a modest uptick, signaling the re-emergence of volatility, potentially tied to seasonal or geopolitical factors. The ""smile-shaped"" curves emphasize higher IV for both out-of-the-money (OTM) puts and calls, characteristic of commodity markets where extreme price movements are often hedged.

A subtle asymmetry in the curves shows higher IV for OTM puts than OTM calls, indicative of a ""put skew."" This suggests traders were more focused on hedging against downside risks, likely due to concerns about falling crude oil prices. 

The decline in IV from October to December could have benefited option buyers as premiums fell, while the rise in January might reflect renewed uncertainty, creating opportunities for strategic option selling. This trend underscores the importance of monitoring IV dynamics to align trading and hedging strategies with market expectations**

However, the Philadelphia Fed Index for business conditions surged to 44.3 this month, a significant rebound from -16.4 in December.

On the other hand, WTI crude oil prices dipped slightly from five-month highs following the easing of geopolitical risks, with a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Despite this, prices remained elevated, trading around $80 per barrel, due to tighter sanctions on Russia and concerns that the incoming Trump administration may impose stricter sanctions on Iran, another major oil producer.

2025-01-21,"**Technical Outlook and Fundamental Insights on Brent Crude Oil**


While the technical setup for Brent crude oil initially suggested potential gains following the consolidation since August, a downward drift toward $75.50 appears increasingly plausible as underlying fundamentals and market sentiment shift.

The earlier forecasts of a significant supply surplus for 2025 have been moderated due to stronger-than-expected demand from Asia and a slower pace of growth in NGLs and biofuel production. Despite this adjustment, the broader demand-supply balance remains fragile. OPEC+ compliance has helped stabilize prices temporarily, but the market remains sentiment-driven, with downside risks becoming more prominent.


**Key Geopolitical and Fundamental Considerations:**

**U.S. Policy and Production Pressure:**

With Donald Trump in the Oval Office, the emphasis on boosting U.S. oil production is expected to intensify. This could add significant supply to the market, exerting downward pressure on prices. Additionally, if the Russia-Ukraine conflict is resolved, Russia's reintegration into the global oil market would further weigh on prices by increasing supply.


**Geopolitical Risks‚ÄîUnderpriced for Now:**

Although tensions in the Middle East, such as the potential escalation of the Israel-Iran conflict, could theoretically support prices, these risks are unlikely to be fully priced in by the market in the short term. Similarly, sanctions on Venezuela might have a muted immediate impact.


**Sentiment-Driven Markets:**

Market expectations often precede actual developments, and the current geopolitical and supply-side narratives lean toward increased production and eased supply constraints. This outlook supports the possibility of Brent crude drifting lower, barring any unexpected geopolitical shocks.


**Price Outlook:**

The technical resistance near $88‚Äì$90 may not materialize as a sustained move, given the current macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape. Instead, Brent crude appears vulnerable to a decline toward $75.50 as sentiment increasingly shifts to favor a more bearish outlook.

2025-01-22,"Natural gas markets have exhibited weakness, gapping and drifting lower this week, but this decline presents a potential buying opportunity supported by strong seasonal demand and colder days in the U.S. forecast in the near term. In the MCX Natural Gas chart (rupee-based), prices are testing a critical ascending trendline support around the 315/320 levels, accompanied by a bullish RSI divergence. 

This combination suggests waning bearish momentum and a higher probability of a reversal. Traders should closely monitor this zone for signs of a rebound, targeting a recovery toward recent highs, while maintaining disciplined stop-losses below the trendline to mitigate risks.

Similarly, the CME Natural Gas Futures chart (dollar-based) highlights prices nearing a major trendline support at 3.62/3.69 levels, with a bullish divergence on the RSI signaling potential accumulation and improving momentum. While these support levels bolster the prospects of a rebound, traders should be mindful of near-term volatility stemming from the upcoming futures contract rollover and forecasts of warmer temperatures ahead. 

Both charts emphasize key support zones, providing an ideal setup for ""buy-the-dip"" strategies. Positional long traders holding or planning to initiate positions should consider maintaining stops below 310 levels on MCX for effective risk management while capitalizing on the rebound potential.

2025-01-24,"Gold rose close to a record high after US President Donald Trump signaled a less aggressive approach to China, weakening the dollar.

Bullion traded near $2,780 an ounce, the highest since it touched an all-time high in October. Trump said he‚Äôd ‚Äúrather not have to use‚Äù levies against China during an interview that aired on Fox News on Thursday. A gauge of the dollar fell as much as 0.7%, making the precious metal cheaper for most buyers.

Gold is up almost 3% this week, mainly on haven demand amid uncertainty over the global economic outlook. New US-imposed tariffs would benefit gold even in spite of accompanying dollar strengthening, according to Joni Teves, a strategist for UBS Group AG. 

‚ÄúWe expect investors to be willing to look through dollar strength,‚Äù Teves wrote in a note, adding that gold would draw demand as a safe haven and diversifier in a period of volatility and macro uncertainty.

Traders have been glued to Trump‚Äôs commentary on trade and tariffs since he took office earlier this week. The president has identified China, the EU, Canada and Mexico as potential targets for import levies, raising concerns about how other governments might respond. Trump on Thursday told the World Economic Forum in Davos via video that he intends to hit Europe with import levies in a bid to bring manufacturing back to the US. 

The US president also said he would demand an immediate drop in interest rates. While lower borrowing costs are typically bullish for precious metals, traders were cautious as monetary policy is set by the Federal Reserve alone. 

Bullion also got support from the latest data that showed US business activity expanding at the slowest pace in nine months on a pullback in the pace of growth at services providers. That may strengthen the case for the Fed to continue carrying out rate cuts. The US central bank is due to make a rate decision next week.

Gold set a series of records last year, with gains driven by the Fed‚Äôs pivot to cutting rates, geopolitical tensions and central-bank buying. Traders are now also focusing on Trump‚Äôs domestic agenda, including his pledges to cut taxes and overhaul immigration. Such moves may erode the nation‚Äôs finances and reignite inflation, potentially complicating the Fed‚Äôs rate-
cutting path.

2025-01-24,"**SILVER: Major bullish accumulation**

Silver‚Äôs chart showcases a beautiful setup, marked by a prolonged consolidation phase and underperformance relative to gold. This underperformance is reflected in the Gold-to-Silver ratio, which has risen towards the key resistance zone of 91‚Äì92. 

Historically, this level has seen multiple rejections, signaling a potential shift in favor of silver outperformance. Each time the ratio reached these levels, silver gained momentum, and the ratio started drifting lower. Currently, silver has rebounded strongly from a major cluster support near $30 and is poised to challenge three significant resistance levels ahead.

Positioning in the speculative market remains moderately short, providing ample room for a short squeeze and long buildup. A decisive breakout above $31 would act as a catalyst, potentially driving prices towards $32.25 and even $33.25. With solid technicals, bullish accumulation, and favourable positioning dynamics, silver seems primed for a strong move higher if resistance levels are cleared decisively.

MCX Gold Futures reached an all-time high of ‚Çπ80,312 per 10 grams, and settled positive for the 5th consecutive week at ‚Çπ80,026. 

COMEX Gold Futures rose over 1% last week to close marginally below $2,780 per ounce. Earlier on Friday, prices climbed to $2,795 per ounce supported by heightened global economic uncertainty and U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs call for immediate interest rate cuts boosted gold‚Äôs appeal as a safe-haven asset.

Moreover, a weaker U.S. dollar, which fell to a one-month low, further supported gold‚Äôs upward momentum while concerns over Trump‚Äôs proposed tariffs and immigration policies have added to market caution, driving investors towards gold.

As traders await the Fed‚Äôs meeting next week, the market continues to speculate on Trump‚Äôs protectionist policies' long-term economic impact.

2025-01-27,"***India gold market update***

***Indian Gold ETF Inflows Slow in December but Annual Growth Remains Strong***
Indian gold ETFs witnessed their eighth consecutive month of net inflows in December, though the pace slowed considerably compared to previous months. This deceleration likely stemmed from a decline in gold prices during the month. Despite this, robust investor interest persisted, driven by equity market volatility, a bullish gold outlook, and the ease of investing through gold ETFs. Inflows for 2024 reached a record INR 112 billion, with assets under management surging by 63% to INR 446 billion. This strong demand was further fueled by the rise of multi-asset funds, which significantly increased their allocations to gold ETFs.

***RBI Pauses Gold Purchases in December but Annual Buying Remains Significant***
After 11 months of consistent purchases, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) halted gold acquisitions in December. However, the central bank's overall gold purchases in 2024 reached 72.6 tonnes, marking a significant increase from the previous year and solidifying its position as the second-largest gold buyer among central banks. Gold now constitutes 10.6% of the RBI's forex reserves, up from 7.7% a year ago, reflecting its commitment to diversifying its reserves and hedging against external risks.

***Gold Imports Revised Downward but Remain Substantial***
The Ministry of Commerce revised gold import data for April to November 2024 downwards, primarily due to double-counting during data migration. Despite this correction, total gold imports for 2024 are estimated to be around 724 tonnes, slightly lower than the previous year. However, the value of imports rose by 21% to US$52 billion, reflecting the higher gold price.

2025-01-27,"**""The Final Dance: Are We Witnessing the Last Surge Before the Global Market Collapse?""
**


As US equity markets continue to soar, fueled by a handful of tech giants, the world watches with bated breath. But beneath the surface, a dangerous divergence is brewing‚Äîone that could signal the beginning of the end for the current bull run. Welcome to what we call the **Global Top Out Parade.**

Late last year, we sounded the alarm: a significant and structural increase in volatility across all asset classes is on the horizon. The accelerating de-dollarization and the fragmentation of the global economy into regional powerhouses are creating a chaotic phase for the world. And now, the signs are unmistakable.



**The Silver/Gold Ratio vs. Nasdaq: A Divergence That Speaks Volumes**


The chart above reveals a growing chasm between the silver/gold ratio and the Nasdaq. Historically, silver outperforms gold during global industrial upswings, given its extensive use in industrial and tech sectors. However, when silver consistently underperforms gold over extended periods while the Nasdaq skyrockets, it‚Äôs a red flag. This divergence is not just a blip‚Äîit‚Äôs a harbinger of a significant correction.

We are currently in the throes of a major divergence. As the US equity bubble continues to inflate, driven by what we term the **Trump Disruption**, this gap could widen even further in the coming months. But remember, the final stages of a bubble are often the most explosive. History shows that these phases can last between 6 to 12 months, with prices going vertical before the inevitable pop and collapse.


**2025: The Year the World May Never Forget**

Mark your calendars. 2025 could be a year etched in the annals of financial history. The convergence of these factors suggests that we are heading into a period of unprecedented volatility and potential market upheaval. The question isn‚Äôt if, but when.


**Brace Yourself: The Countdown to Chaos Has Begun**

As we stand on the precipice of what could be one of the most tumultuous periods in modern financial history, one thing is clear: the final dance is underway. Will you be ready when the music stops?

Stay tuned. The next few years are going to be anything but ordinary.

2025-01-27,"Natural gas prices declined last week after the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a 223 Bcf storage withdrawal. While substantial, the withdrawal fell short of market expectations and left inventories slightly above the five-year average. This highlighted improving supply conditions, further weighing on prices. In addition, updated weather forecasts suggested a colder air mass could sweep across the northern U.S. in early February, offering some near-term demand support. On the global front, European gas prices have also eased recently, thanks to milder-than-expected winter weather and steady LNG imports, keeping storage levels in Europe comfortable. This has added to the overall bearish sentiment in global natural gas markets.

As we transition into February, price volatility is expected to increase as traders begin looking past the winter season toward the lower-demand ""shoulder season"" of spring. In Europe, declining concerns over energy shortages could further cap upside momentum in global prices. Domestically, price action suggests strong support near ‚Çπ320, with the next critical level at ‚Çπ285. Resistance remains near ‚Çπ360-‚Çπ370. The market appears cautious, with these key levels likely to dictate the next directional move, influenced by both U.S. and European dynamics.

2025-01-27,"**Tech Turmoil Sparks Market Sell-Off: Silver on the Brink as Risk-Off Sentiment Grips Global Markets**



US stocks are expected to open under significant pressure today, driven by a sharp sell-off in tech shares following the weekend release of Deep Seek GenAI. This development has triggered a broad risk-off sentiment across financial markets. Investors are seeking safer assets, resulting in increased demand for US Treasuries and a corresponding drop in bond yields. At the same time, the US dollar is weakening, while commodities are broadly under pressure as risk aversion takes hold.

Even gold, traditionally a safe-haven asset, has not been spared from the sell-off. However, the gold-silver ratio is rising, as silver‚Äîbeing more sensitive to the tech sector, copper, and equity markets‚Äîis experiencing steeper losses than gold.

**Key technical levels to monitor include the critical support zone for silver spot prices at USD 29.90‚Äì30.00. A breach of this zone could trigger significant stop-loss selling, potentially accelerating the downward momentum in silver. Traders should remain alert, as a break below this level could signal heightened weakness in other risk-sensitive assets, amplifying the broader market's risk-off tone.**

2025-01-27,"Oil prices are continuing to trend lower following January's spike, driven by fresh sanctions imposed by the Biden administration on Russia. However, diplomatic overtures by the new U.S. administration toward resolving the Ukraine crisis, coupled with a temporary lull in tensions in West Asia, are gradually eroding the geopolitical risk premium that had supported elevated oil prices. This decline in geopolitical tensions is reducing the excess profits previously enjoyed by oil drillers. 

Additionally, under the Trump administration, there has been a clear shift in focus toward supporting the oil and gas industry. Trump‚Äôs pro-energy policies aim to reduce regulatory burdens and boost U.S. output, with a significant push for increased exports. While this benefits the industry domestically, it could weigh on global oil prices due to higher supply levels.

Over the medium term, oil prices are likely to remain under pressure, potentially sliding toward $71 on WTI. A break below this level could expose $67 as the next support. On the upside, prices are expected to remain capped around $77-$78. On the MCX, crude oil prices could drift toward ‚Çπ6,150, with the upside limited to ‚Çπ6,700-‚Çπ6,750. The overall bias remains bearish.

Earlier, the U.S. Treasury Secretary proposed a universal tariff plan starting at 2.5%, with gradual increases each month. However, Bessent's measured approach appears to clash with President Trump‚Äôs vision.

Trump has firmly stated that he wants tariffs significantly higher than 2.5%, although the exact level is yet to be determined. This uncertainty is already impacting markets, with the USD catching fresh bids, driving U.S. yields higher.

The ripple effect is weighing on commodities, particularly gold and silver, as the stronger dollar and rising yields exert downward pressure on precious metals.

2025-01-29,"The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is set for post-midnight in India (12:30 am), with markets widely expecting the bank to hold rates steady. Fed Fund Futures indicate a 99.5% probability of this outcome.

Markets anticipate a potential rate cut in June, followed by another in October. With the ""on hold"" scenario nearly priced in, focus shifts to the FOMC statement and Fed Chair Powell's press conference, scheduled 30 minutes after the decision. 

If Powell's tone is hawkish, signaling a prolonged pause in rate adjustments, it may strengthen the US dollar while pressuring gold prices due to their inverse correlation.

Conversely, a dovish stance could weaken the dollar and support gold. However, contradictory signals from the statement and the press conference could trigger a mixed market reaction. 

Investors are closely monitoring these events for insights into the Fed‚Äôs future monetary policy trajectory.

2025-01-30,"**Gold Rush to New York Creates Shortage in London Amid Trump Tariff Fears**


A surge in gold shipments to the US has caused a shortage of bullion in London, with traders amassing an $82 billion stockpile in New York due to fears of potential tariffs under a Trump administration. The wait to withdraw gold from the Bank of England‚Äôs vaults has increased from a few days to 4-8 weeks, as demand outstrips supply. Since the US election, 393 metric tonnes of gold have been moved to Comex vaults in New York, raising inventory levels by 75% to 926 tonnes, the highest since August 2022. Additional shipments to private vaults in New York, owned by HSBC and JPMorgan, may further increase US gold inflows.


Traders are motivated by concerns that President Trump could impose tariffs on gold imports, as well as by higher futures prices in New York compared to London‚Äôs cash market, creating an arbitrage opportunity. Gold prices have risen 5% this year, nearing their all-time high. The situation echoes the COVID-19 pandemic, when gold stockpiling surged due to lockdowns and shipment uncertainties.

Comex gold inventories have risen 36% this month, with 244 metric tonnes of inflows, the highest since May 2020. Traders are moving gold to New York to fulfill futures contracts, driving premiums in the futures market.

Spot gold was up 1% at $2,783.95 per ounce, as of 09:41 a.m. (1441 GMT), just $6.2 shy of a record high of $2790.15 hit in October. U.S. gold futures climbed 1.4% to $2,808.

**Options Open Interest Analysis**

**Call Writers Holding Ground:**

Open interest is notably high at the 2,850, 2,875, and 2,900 strike calls, indicating that sellers are actively defending these levels. A decisive breakout above $2,850 could trigger a short squeeze, forcing call sellers to cover their positions and adding upward momentum.


**Lack of Strong Put Writing:**

So far, there hasn‚Äôt been significant put writing, suggesting a cautious stance from traders. However, if gold prices hold firm during the COMEX session, we may see an increase in put open interest as traders gain confidence in the price floor.

The Fed's preferred inflation gauge came in well above the central bank's target of 2%, reinforcing its cautious stance and suggesting that the Fed may maintain its pause on rate cuts for the foreseeable future.

Despite the recovery of the US dollar, gold remained supported near record highs, as concerns over potential trade tariffs by the Trump administration drove safe-haven demand. Meanwhile, metals remained under pressure due to the same concerns.

2025-01-31,"**Trump 2.0: The Catalyst for De-Dollarization and a New Economic Order**


We have long argued that a second Trump presidency will be far more decisive and aggressive in implementing an ""America First"" policy. The U.S. is likely to turn significantly inward, accelerating the global de-dollarization process.

During his first term, Trump‚Äôs team primarily used tariffs as a bargaining chip in global trade negotiations, with limited success. This was because trade flows are ultimately a byproduct of capital flows. Unless capital flows are meaningfully altered, net trade imbalances remain largely unchanged. However, without de-dollarization, how can capital flows be structurally transformed?

Back in 2016, the world was not yet prepared for an advanced phase of de-dollarization or a broader global economic reset. But today, that landscape has shifted. In a potential second term, Trump‚Äôs team is considering using tariffs as a major source of government revenue‚Äîenabling significant tax cuts while offsetting revenue losses through reduced government spending on social welfare programs, a leaner federal workforce, and substantial tariff collections.

Trump‚Äôs advisors have referenced how, before World War II, tariffs were a key revenue source for the U.S. federal budget. However, what they conveniently overlook is that, at that time, the U.S. dollar had not yet attained its status as the world‚Äôs primary reserve currency. Once the global reserve currency transitioned from the British pound to the U.S. dollar post-WWII, America had to abandon high tariffs, embrace open trade in goods, services, and capital, and expand its social safety net to maintain economic stability. Simultaneously, heavy military-industrial spending became a pillar of U.S. economic strategy.

For the U.S. to revert to a pre-WWII economic model‚Äîwhere tariffs play a central role in government revenue and the U.S. becomes a dominant producer rather than a consumer‚Äîit must relinquish the dollar‚Äôs status as the world‚Äôs sole reserve currency. De-dollarization is not just an ideological shift but a structural necessity for such a transformation.

The dollar-based global economic system thrived as long as the U.S. remained the world‚Äôs largest consumer. The U.S. printed dollars, purchased global goods and services, and in doing so, kept the dollar‚Äôs value artificially elevated. A reversal of this trend‚Äîde-dollarization‚Äîwould mark a fundamental shift in global finance.

We are witnessing a historic transition: from a unipolar world dominated by a single reserve currency backed by no tangible asset, toward a multipolar financial system‚Äîpotentially a multi-currency basket, increasingly digital, and possibly backed by gold and other commodities.

A fascinating era is unfolding before our eyes, and we are fortunate to witness and analyze this economic evolution firsthand.

2025-02-03,"The Net Speculative Length oscillator (converted to a percentile score) highlights three major phases of extreme speculative positioning: A (2007-2008), B (2009-2011), and C (2023-2024). In Phase A, speculative positioning surged before the 2008 financial crisis, leading to volatility but eventually aligning with rising gold prices. In Phase B, persistent extreme speculative bullishness fueled a major gold rally that peaked in 2011. However, once speculative sentiment declined, gold entered a prolonged bear phase. Now, in Phase C (2023-2024), speculative sentiment has once again reached its highest historical percentile, coinciding with another strong gold rally.


The historical pattern suggests that sustained speculative extremes often precede market turning points or corrections, though timing varies. If speculative positioning in Phase C remains elevated, gold could continue its rally. However, if positioning starts to unwind, it may indicate a potential slowdown or reversal in gold‚Äôs uptrend. Monitoring macroeconomic conditions‚Äîsuch as real interest rates, the dollar, and central bank policies‚Äîalongside speculative positioning will be key in assessing whether gold‚Äôs momentum remains intact or if history repeats with a market correction similar to 2011-2013.

(Reuters)

China has retaliated against new U.S. tariffs by imposing levies on American imports, escalating trade tensions between the two largest economies. The U.S. implemented a 10% tariff on all Chinese exports starting Tuesday, citing concerns over illicit drug flows. In response, Beijing imposed a 15% tariff on U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal, along with a 10% duty on crude oil and farm equipment.

Additionally, China launched an anti-monopoly investigation into Google and enforced export controls on key rare earth elements, including tungsten, tellurium, ruthenium, and molybdenum, citing national security interests. These minerals are vital for advanced technologies and the clean energy sector, underscoring China's strategic leverage in global supply chains.

Meanwhile, Trump announced a temporary suspension of tariffs on Mexico and Canada for one month, with both nations agreeing to strengthen border enforcement. The renewed trade dispute highlights ongoing economic and geopolitical tensions, as both sides leverage tariffs and regulatory measures to assert their interests.

In 2024, China‚Äôs domestic gold production exceeded 377.24 metric tons, reflecting a modest year-on-year increase of 0.56 percent, according to the China Gold Association. However, gold consumption declined to 985.31 tons, down 9.58 percent. Jewelry demand fell sharply by 24.69 percent to 532.02 tons, while investment demand for gold bars and coins surged 24.54 percent to 373.13 tons.

Despite a slowdown in jewelry sales, Chinese gold and jewelry companies adapted by innovating product offerings, with traditional and ""Chinese style"" gold jewelry gaining traction. Meanwhile, China‚Äôs large gold conglomerates increased overseas gold production by 19.14 percent to 71.937 tons.

The People‚Äôs Bank of China added 44.17 tons to its reserves, reaching 2,279.57 tons, solidifying its position as the world‚Äôs sixth-largest gold holder.

2025-02-05,"**Gold Demand Hits Record High in 2024, Driven by Central Banks and Investors**

Gold demand soared to an all-time high in 2024, fueled by aggressive central bank buying, resilient investment activity, and surging technological demand. However, high prices weighed on jewellery consumption.

For the third consecutive year, central banks purchased over 1,000 tonnes of gold, with Q4 witnessing a sharp acceleration in buying. Global gold ETFs, despite early outflows, rebounded strongly in the second half, contributing to the metal‚Äôs price rally.

Bar and coin investment remained steady, with Eastern markets capitalizing on rising prices, while Western investors engaged in profit-taking. Jewellery demand, however, declined by 11% due to record-high prices, although its total market value soared to $144 billion.

On the supply side, global gold production grew by 1% year-on-year, with both mining and recycling contributing to the rise. Preliminary estimates indicate mine production reached a record 4,974 tonnes, marking a historic peak in available supply.

With robust central bank acquisitions and strong investor interest, gold solidified its status as a premier safe-haven asset in 2024.

Looking ahead to 2025, central banks and ETF investors are expected to drive demand, supported by economic uncertainty and gold's role as a risk hedge. However, jewelry demand may remain under pressure.

2025-02-05,"**Gold climbed to a fresh record high, as
trade-war worries bolstered haven demand and there were continued signs of short-term tightness in the market.**

Bullion rallied as much as 1.2% to exceed $2,877 an ounce on Wednesday. Prices have been supported by concerns about the
fallout of trade wars, particularly between the US and China.

Markets are also waiting to see if there are any ripple effects for US monetary policy if tariffs reignite inflation.

There are indications of increased demand for gold as major dealers seek to shift metal to the US before any tariffs are imposed. One month so-called lease rates in London have jumped to about 4.7%, far above previous levels of close to zero. The rate reflects the return that holders of bullion in London‚Äôs vaults can get by loaning their metal out to other buyers on a short-term basis.

Bloomberg last week reported that the rush for gold has led to weeks-long queues to withdraw bullion from the Bank of England ‚Äî where many central banks around the world hold reserves ‚Äî to deposit with private banks. Gold has also been flowing into depositories of New York‚Äôs Comex exchange.

That has added to tightness in the market, according to Rhona O‚ÄôConnell, head of market analysis for EMEA and Asia at StoneX Group Inc.

The typical 400-ounce bars that are traded in London aren‚Äôt suited for the Comex market, where traders must deliver 100-ounce or kilobars, but they can be refined in places like Switzerland.

‚ÄúMetal is still going into Comex warehouses and elsewhere in the States,‚Äù said O‚ÄôConnell. 

Authorities could possibly even
intervene by lending out gold if the situation became drastic enough, she said. ‚ÄúIf it gets much tighter or threatens to become disorderly I would not be surprised if the official sector injected liquidity, because one thing that central banks won‚Äôt tolerate is a disorderly gold market.‚Äù

The dollar extended losses, following a US jobs report on Tuesday that pointed to a gradual slowdown in the labor market.

A weaker greenback makes commodities like gold cheaper for most buyers.

Spot gold gained 1% to $2,870.09 an ounce as of 12:32 p.m. in London. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was down 0.3%. Silver, platinum and palladium rose.

2025-02-07,"Markets had a muted reaction to the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, as the weaker-than-expected job growth in January was offset by upward revisions to the previous two months.

Nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 143,000 in January, down from an upwardly revised 307,000 in December, but still in line with the average monthly gain of 166,000 in 2024. November‚Äôs payrolls were revised up by 49,000, from 212,000 to 261,000, while December‚Äôs figure was revised up by 51,000, from 256,000 to 307,000.

The January downturn was partly offset by the significant upward revision to December's number. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate unexpectedly dropped from 4.1% to 4.0%.

However, wage growth was stronger-than-expected, sending mixed signals about the US labor market. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month-over-month and 4.1% year-over-year, surpassing expectations of 0.3% and 3.8%, respectively. **__Overall, the jobs report suggests a moderating but still healthy labor market, likely keeping the Fed on a ""higher for longer"" rate path.__**

Gold prices surged to record highs, **with front month MCX gold futures surpassing ‚Çπ85,000 per 10 grams** and COMEX gold futures holding above $2,900 per ounce fueled by expectations of monetary easing from major central banks. 

Global monetary policy shifts have reinforced gold‚Äôs appeal. The Bank of England recently delivered a rate cut with a dovish tilt, while the RBI executed its first rate cut since the pandemic response. The ECB and BoC have also eased policies, with the latter ending quantitative tightening.

Meanwhile, China‚Äôs central bank expanded its gold reserves for the third consecutive month in January, adding 0.16 million troy ounces despite soaring prices. Central banks have remained key drivers of gold demand, collectively purchasing over 1,000 tonnes for the third consecutive year, with Q4 2024 acquisitions reaching 333 tonnes, according to the World Gold Council.

Today, U.S. job growth slowed in January, with nonfarm payrolls rising by 143,000, falling short of estimates. Despite a 4.0% unemployment rate, the Federal Reserve is expected to delay rate cuts until at least June.

Macroeconomic uncertainties, widening U.S. fiscal deficits, and deglobalization trends have further bolstered gold‚Äôs status as a hedge against financial instability. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China, along with supply disruptions in the London gold market, have tightened physical availability, with Bank of England withdrawals reportedly delayed by up to four weeks. Goldman Sachs maintains gold as its ""highest conviction trade,"" citing strong central bank demand and geopolitical risks, including China‚Äôs potential tariff retaliation and heightened Middle East tensions.

2025-02-10,"**Unlike gold, speculative positioning in silver remains relatively restrained, reflected in its measured ascent rather than a parabolic surge. The metal has lagged behind gold, weighed down by its industrial-heavy demand profile, which makes it less of a safe-haven magnet when equity markets wobble and the dollar stays firm.

However, copper‚Äôs recent breakout‚Äîaligned with our positional outlook‚Äîcould offer a tailwind for silver, if the dollar shows signs of near-term fatigue.

That said, silver may start drawing attention as traders look for the next play. With gold rallying on de-dollarization trends, rising policy and fiscal risks in the U.S., and an escalating global trade war, silver could find itself back in the spotlight.**

2025-02-11,"**Strong economy means no hurry to cut rates:  Powell**

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, signaled that the central bank is in no hurry to cut interest rates, emphasizing that the U.S. economy remains strong. With unemployment at 4%‚Äîa level consistent with full employment‚Äîand inflation still above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, Powell underscored the need for a cautious approach to monetary policy.

He reiterated that premature or excessive rate cuts could hinder progress in controlling inflation. The Fed's decision to hold interest rates steady in January reflects its commitment to balancing inflation control with economic stability. Powell acknowledged the economic ""risks and uncertainties"" arising from the Trump administration‚Äôs trade tariffs, labor force policies, and potential tax and regulatory changes, though he did not explicitly detail their impact.

Reaffirming the Fed‚Äôs dual mandate of stable inflation and maximum employment, Powell stated that current policy is well-positioned to manage potential economic fluctuations. His testimony, spanning two days, comes as the central bank evaluates the broader implications of federal policies on an already resilient economy.

Hammack outlined two key factors supporting the need for a patient approach to monetary policy. She pointed to lingering upside risks to inflation, including the strength of consumer spending and the potential for last year‚Äôs rate cuts to stoke economic activity with a lag.

The Cleveland Fed chief also highlighted uncertainty around new government policies, like those pertaining to regulation, taxes, immigration and tariffs. She said it will take ‚Äúsome time‚Äù to analyze these and decide on the appropriate monetary policy response. (Bloomberg)

2025-02-12,"**Tariff Update
**
Since taking office, President Donald Trump has implemented sweeping measures to reshape global trade, with the recent imposition of 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports standing as a defining policy move. 

The tariffs aim to bolster domestic production by making foreign metals more expensive, thus protecting politically significant industries in the U.S., particularly in Rust Belt states. Canada, the largest supplier of both metals to the U.S., will bear the brunt, accounting for 58% of aluminum and 23% of steel imports in recent years. The levies also target imports from Mexico, Brazil, and South Korea, with little clarity on exemptions, though Australia has received preferential treatment. 

While these measures aim to combat trade deficits and protect U.S. industries, they risk straining ties with key allies and exacerbating inflationary pressures on consumers.

Notably, Trump‚Äôs tariffs extend beyond raw materials to include downstream finished products, signaling broader economic implications. Critics argue that the levies could raise costs across sectors reliant on specialty grades of steel and aluminum, such as construction, aerospace, and auto manufacturing, while failing to significantly boost domestic output. 

During Trump‚Äôs first term, similar tariffs coincided with a decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs and industrial production, raising doubts about the efficacy of such policies. The tariffs, implemented under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, highlight Trump‚Äôs broader strategy of leveraging trade as a negotiating tool, though his willingness to grant exemptions or alter plans creates uncertainty. As global trade flows adapt, retaliatory measures, particularly from China, could further disrupt markets, while domestic industries and consumers brace for higher costs and limited supply.

While the policy aims for long-term economic benefits, its broader implications, such as heightened consumer prices and diplomatic tensions underscore the uncertainty it introduces into both the domestic and international markets.

2025-02-12,"**Israeli military calls up reservists as concern over Gaza ceasefire mounts**

(Reuters)

Israel has mobilized reservists amid concerns that the Gaza ceasefire could collapse if Hamas does not release additional Israeli hostages by the Saturday deadline. The ceasefire, in effect since January 19, stipulated that Hamas would free three more hostages. However, the group recently suspended releases, citing Israeli violations. U.S. President Donald Trump warned that if all hostages were not freed by noon Saturday, he would ""let hell break out,"" while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaled a resumption of military operations if Hamas fails to comply.

The crisis raises fears of further escalation, with Israel deploying additional forces and reinforcing its southern border. While Hamas has reaffirmed its commitment to the agreement, negotiations remain uncertain. Mediators are actively working to prevent a breakdown of the ceasefire.

**Gold prices are expected to rise amid heightened geopolitical tensions, as investors turn to the metal as a safe-haven asset. Uncertainty in the West Asia could further drive demand, influencing short-term price volatility.**

2025-02-12,"The US Midwest aluminum premium, which reflects additional cost above LME prices, saw a dramatic surge of 18% in a single session on February 3, after President Trump signed an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on aluminum and steel imports from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% duty on imports from China.

On Feb 10, Trump announced blanket tariffs on both steel and aluminum imports to US, to support US industries and bolster job creation, pushing premiums higher again, reaching 30 cents/pound, highlighting significant price disparity between US aluminum and aluminum in other regions.

During Trump's first term, premiums doubled from Jan-June 2018, when his tariffs took effect on June 1. In contrast, impact on premiums this year has been less pronounced, partly due to expectations of negotiations before March 12 deadline. If tariffs remain in place, US could face potentially steeper premiums and higher domestic prices in the near term.

Global gold ETFs recorded net inflows of $3 billion in January 2025, marking a second consecutive month of gains amid rising gold prices. Total assets under management (AUM) reached a record $294 billion, with holdings rebounding by 34 tonnes. Meanwhile, global gold trading volumes surged 20%, driven by increased OTC and exchange activity.

Europe led inflows, adding $3.4 billion‚Äîthe largest monthly increase since March 2022. UK investors turned to gold as falling bond yields, weak economic data, and expectations of Bank of England rate cuts supported demand. In Germany, political uncertainty, economic pessimism, and US trade concerns fueled safe-haven buying, while France saw strong inflows amid political instability and slowing growth.

North America saw outflows of $499 million as early optimism around President Trump‚Äôs inauguration faded. Profit-taking, record gold prices, and shifting market sentiment outweighed late-month demand following the Fed‚Äôs rate decision and a tech stock selloff.

In Asia, Indian gold ETFs attracted a record $400 million amid global uncertainty and weak equities. Conversely, Chinese funds saw outflows as strong GDP growth bolstered risk appetite. Other regions, including Australia and South Africa, recorded $66 million in inflows.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Gold Value Reset ‚Äì Treasury updates its gold valuation, increasing its assets.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Fed Credits Treasury ‚Äì The Fed issues a new credit to the Treasury‚Äôs General Account (TGA), boosting available funds.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Debt Repayment ‚Äì Treasury uses the extra liquidity to pay down short-term Treasury bills (T-bills) instead of issuing new debt.


**üîπ Will This Reduce Government Debt? üö®**


‚ùå Not really! The total debt obligations in the financial system remain the same, even if short-term debt is repaid. Here‚Äôs why:


‚úÖ Yes, the official Treasury debt figure drops.


‚ùå But the Fed will have to sell bonds to neutralize liquidity effects.

‚ùå Investors will still hold the same amount of Treasury debt, just in different forms (bonds instead of T-bills).


**üîπ ‚ùóÔ∏èIt‚Äôs NOT Monetization‚ùóÔ∏è**

Until and unless the U.S. Treasury sells gold in the open market, there is NO realized gain. This is just an accounting gimmick of using unrealized gains from asset revaluation.

üí° Monetization happens only when gold is sold for actual cash, like when European central banks sold gold in the 90s (quite stupidly).


**üîπ Example Using Balance Sheets**

__Before Revaluation:__

üìå Treasury Debt = $34T

üìå Gold Reserves (at $42.22) = $11B

üìå Fed holds $7.5T of Treasury bonds


__After Revaluation:__

üìå Treasury Debt ‚Üì to $33.3T (paid down $700B in T-bills)

üìå Gold Reserves (at $2,900) = $750B

üìå Fed must sell $700B in bonds to balance its books



**üîπ Key Takeaways for Investors**

üìå This is an accounting trick, not real debt reduction.

üìå The market still needs to digest the same amount of Treasury debt.

üìå The Fed‚Äôs role will be crucial ‚Äì any missteps could increase bond market volatility.

üìå If implemented, this could impact gold prices, bond yields, and the USD.


**üîπ Investment Implications**

‚ö°Ô∏è Gold could see continued demand if investors believe in further monetization.

‚ö°Ô∏è Bond markets may react to liquidity shifts from the Fed‚Äôs response. As overall fresh debt issuance will drop, long term yield may soften but how much, that is an open question, as Fed may have to sell long term bonds as a part of expanded QT to offset bank reserves.

‚ö°Ô∏è Short-term relief for the U.S. debt ceiling, but long-term fiscal challenges remain.


**__üí° Bottom Line: Gold revaluation is a creative move but doesn‚Äôt truly reduce U.S. debt‚Äîit just shifts liabilities within the system. Until gold is sold in the market, there‚Äôs no real monetization! Watch Treasury and Fed actions for market reactions! üìäüìâ__**

2025-02-13,"**America First Policy and the Inevitable Collision with China: A Key Driver of De-dollarization**

The America First policy, with its medium- to long-term goal of transforming the U.S. from a consumer-driven economy to a producer-oriented one, naturally puts it on a collision course with China. This shift represents yet another dimension of the broader de-dollarization trend.

Since the 1970s, dollarization has allowed the U.S. to print money backed by global confidence in its economy while relying on China and other nations to produce goods and services. The U.S. effectively paid for imports with what was essentially free money‚Äîan exorbitant privilege. However, that model has now reached its expiry date and is being systematically reversed. As a result, neither China, the U.S., nor other key producers of goods and services can continue operating under the old business-as-usual framework.

The global trade landscape is on the verge of a permanent reset‚Äîa transition toward a multipolar world order where internal consumption and regional trade blocs will take precedence over the once-dominant global supply chains.

Interesting times ahead.

2025-02-14,"The U.S. dollar fell to a two-month low of 106.7, driven down by weaker-than-expected retail sales data. This latest dip in the greenback follows a series of economic factors putting pressure on the currency, including a delay in reciprocal tariffs and a pullback in U.S. Treasury yields. 

The 10-year Treasury yield, which had surged to 4.66% following the CPI report, completely erased its gains after the release of the PPI report. Some components of the PPI, which feed into the PCE, softened, fueling hopes for a lower-than-expected PCE reading.

Commerce Department data showed Friday, value of retail purchases in the US, not adjusted for inflation, decreased 0.9% after an upwardly revised 0.7% gain in December. This marks the largest decline in nearly two years, signaling a sharp slowdown in consumer spending after a surge in the final months of 2024.

2025-02-17,"**India's gold import tariff, administered by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), has shown a clear upward trend over the past year, as illustrated in the above graph**.

Beginning at ‚Çπ639 per 10 grams in early February 2024, the tariff rose to ‚Çπ938 by February 2025. This increase reflects CBIC's dynamic approach to gold import duties, likely responding to fluctuations in international gold prices. 

The graph's stepped pattern indicates fortnightly revisions, demonstrating CBIC's active management to align tariffs with global market dynamics. 

This frequent adjustment ensures accurate duty collection and safeguards government revenue. The higher tariff observed in late 2024 and early 2025 suggests a period of elevated global gold prices or potential currency exchange rate variations.

2025-02-17,"COMEX gold futures declined over 1.5% on Friday due to profit-taking and settled just above $2,900/oz. However, it close with the 7th consecutive weekly gain, driven by escalating global trade war concerns following U.S. President Trump's directive for reciprocal tariffs.

Technically, the failure to surpass Tuesday‚Äôs all-time high suggests a potential double-top formation, prompting weekend profit-taking. However, Trump‚Äôs proposed tariffs could fuel further safe-haven demand.

In the U.S., retail sales fell by 0.9% MoM in January, the sharpest decline in nearly two years while industrial production grew by 0.5%, surpassing forecasts but slowing from December‚Äôs 1% expansion.

Traders expect Fed to maintain rates until September due to persistent inflation concerns. Despite a resilient labor market, gold remains bullish, supported by tariff fears, inflation, a weaker dollar, and rising physical gold demand.

2025-02-17,"The INSTC (International North-South Transport Corridor), Chennai-Vladivostok, and IMEEC (India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor) trade routes are set to become the most critical corridors in the coming years and decades as the world pivots toward a multipolar global order. With Bharat at the center of these developments, its strategic position is unparalleled.

Key Trade Corridors and Their Strategic Importance:

INSTC: A 7,200 km-long multimodal corridor connecting Western Bharat with Russia via Iran and the Caspian Sea. Goods from Mumbai, Mundra, and Kandla travel to Bandar Abbas or Chabahar (Iran), move overland to Bandar Anzali, cross the Caspian Sea to Astrakhan (Russia), and continue via rail and road to Moscow and Europe. This route reduces transit time by 30-40% and cuts costs by up to 30% compared to the traditional Suez Canal route.

IMEEC: Connects Bharat with West Asia, Europe, and the US, forming a strategic alternative to China‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative. This corridor strengthens energy security, trade, and infrastructure ties with Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Europe while opening direct trade pathways to North America.

Chennai-Vladivostok: Covers major economic centers across South and East Asia to Russia, reinforcing Bharat‚Äôs influence in the Indo-Pacific and the Russian Far East. This corridor ensures direct access to key mineral resources and energy hubs in the region.


As the US dollar transitions from its singular dominance to a multi-currency system, potentially backed by gold and other commodities and digitally linked, the full impact of this shift will likely be felt from 2030 onwards.

This transformation is also reshaping West Asia, re-engineering it into a highly secular and ultra-modern economic powerhouse, as the petrodollar era fades and real economic fundamentals take precedence.

These are extraordinary times, and for those of us in the currency and commodities markets, this shift will be felt like no other. By the 2030s, the way we trade commodities and currencies is set for a complete overhaul, marking the dawn of a new financial paradigm.

üá∑üá∫ **U.S. and Russian officials met in Riyadh for their first direct talks on ending the Ukraine war, with Kyiv and European allies excluded.**

 Moscow demanded NATO formally revoke its 2008 pledge of future membership for Ukraine. The meeting follows President Donald Trump's recent phone call with Vladimir Putin, raising concerns that the U.S. may make concessions unfavorable to Ukraine. U.S. officials argue they are acknowledging geopolitical realities, while Kyiv insists no deal can be made without its participation. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated NATO‚Äôs non-admission stance is insufficient. The discussions may pave the way for a Trump-Putin meeting, signaling potential shifts in U.S.-Russia diplomacy.

üáÆüá± **Israel will begin indirect negotiations with Hamas this week on the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar announced.**

 The talks, mediated by Qatar, Egypt, and the U.S., were initially set for February 2 but faced delays. Israel demands Gaza‚Äôs complete demilitarization and rejects any continued Hamas presence. Despite past uncertainties, Saar confirmed Israel‚Äôs commitment if discussions remain constructive. The first phase of the ceasefire, which began on January 19, has facilitated hostage exchanges. Israel aims to secure the release of six living hostages and four deceased individuals. Meanwhile, Israel will allow mobile homes for displaced Gazans amid widespread destruction from the ongoing conflicts.

Speaking to state broadcaster CCTV, Zheng emphasized plans to ease investment barriers, revise market access restrictions, and provide fair access to infrastructure and scientific research for private firms.

The remarks follow President Xi Jinping‚Äôs rare meeting with top technology leaders, urging them to leverage China's model and market potential. The meeting underscores Beijing‚Äôs efforts to reinvigorate private sector confidence amid economic slowdowns and U.S. restrictions on China's technological development. 

With domestic consumption weakening and the property sector facing instability, Xi highlighted the private sector‚Äôs role in national competitiveness, emphasizing its contributions‚Äîover 50% of tax revenue, 60% of economic output, and 70% of tech innovation.

Analysts suggest that while China is reinforcing the private sector‚Äôs role, further consumption-driven reforms and stimulus are needed to sustain corporate confidence and economic growth.

**MCX gold futures surged to a record ‚Çπ86,592 per 10 grams in today's trade, while COMEX gold futures hovered near an all-time high of $2,964 per ounce in today's trade as market remain cautious amid concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could trigger a global trade war, driving safe-haven demand for bullion. **

Additionally, expectations of a Fed rate cut, prompted by higher inflation and Trump's presidency that continue to introduce macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, reinforcing gold‚Äôs appeal as a hedge.

COMEX spot gold touched a fresh peak of $2,946.97 per ounce during the European session before stabilizing ahead of U.S. trading. Weekly U.S. Mortgage Applications dropped 6.6%, while January housing starts fell 9.8% month-on-month to 1.366 million, with single-family starts declining 8.4%. Building permits rose marginally by 0.1% but were 1.7% lower year-on-year.

Trump‚Äôs announcement of a 25% auto tariff, along with duties on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, has escalated trade tensions. Further uncertainty arises as the White House considers lifting sanctions on Russia, unsettling Europe and Kyiv. 

Meanwhile, the upcoming release of the FOMC minutes from the January meeting later after midnight IST, may provide further insights into the Fed's thinking and could significantly impact gold prices, particularly if the minutes reveal stronger support for holding rates steady than currently perceived by the market.

US commercial crude inventories (excluding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 4.6 million barrels to 432.5 million in the week ending February 14, according to the EIA.

Oil prices gained nearly 3% this week amid OPEC+ uncertainty over output increases and supply disruptions, including a Ukraine drone attack reducing Kazakh pipeline flows by 380,000 b/d. North Dakota‚Äôs extreme cold cut oil production by 120-150k b/d. Meanwhile, Iraq‚Äôs Kurdistan exports may soon resume, potentially adding 300,000 b/d, though Turkey has not confirmed this.

The EU imposed new sanctions on 73 Russian oil vessels, further pressuring market sentiment. While US sanctions have yet to significantly impact Russian exports, floating storage has increased. Market participants remain watchful of evolving supply risks, weather impacts, and geopolitical developments.

2025-02-24,"**Gold prices surged to record highs, with COMEX Gold futures hitting $2,974 and COMEX spot gold reaching $2,956, driven by a weaker U.S. dollar, trade tension and heightened geopolitical uncertainties.**

The dollar declined following reports of slowing U.S. business activity, weakening consumer confidence, and rising inflation expectations, leading markets to price in further Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, according to Bloomberg.

Meanwhile, Reuters reported that Russia launched its largest drone assault on Ukraine, with 267 attack drones deployed overnight. Ukraine‚Äôs air force neutralized 138 drones, with another 119 disrupted via electronic warfare. Moscow also launched three ballistic missiles, causing damage across five regions. Over the past week, Russia has intensified its aerial offensive, deploying nearly 1,150 attack drones, 1,400 guided bombs, and 35 missiles.

The G7 meeting remains divided over a joint statement marking the three-year anniversary of Russia‚Äôs invasion, with U.S. opposition to further energy sanctions and direct condemnation of Moscow.

Traders are now focused on upcoming U.S. GDP data for Q4 2024, which could influence Federal Reserve policy. The CME Fed Futures indicate a 46.0% probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut in June, overtaking the 42.3% odds for no change. A weaker PMI reading last week suggests further downside risks, potentially triggering lower yields and increased monetary easing.

After touching all-time highs, gold prices experienced some pull-back due to profit taken by the short term traders.

2025-02-24,"**Back in November 2024, right after Trump‚Äôs victory, we were already saying that dedollarization was about to hit a turbocharged phase, unraveling globalization with a vengeance. We called it then: a sharp pivot toward domestic consumption and regional trade, driven by the sleek, unrelenting force of the ""America First"" agenda. This wasn‚Äôt just a policy shift‚Äîit was a masterstroke to reshape the U.S., long the world‚Äôs top consumer propped up by an artificially juiced dollar, into a lean, mean producing machine.


We saw the hard decoupling from China coming a mile away, a surgical strike on trade ties that‚Äôs now unfolding in real time. The next two years, as we predicted, are shaping up to be a rollercoaster‚Äîvolatility roaring back with a swagger, ready to ""Make Volatility Super Again."" And it‚Äôs hitting the gas hard.

One more move we‚Äôd bet on? The ""America First"" playbook could push for a deliberate, jaw-dropping devaluation of the dollar‚Äîpossibly kicking off late this year or early next, stretching over the next five to seven years. Unlike a consumer nation that thrives on an overvalued currency to gobble up imports, a producer-state USA‚Äîthe future we envisioned‚Äîneeds the exact opposite: a dollar hammered down against the heavyweights of the BRICS-plus bloc.

Zelenskiy urged Ukraine‚Äôs allies to remain united for a ""just and lasting peace,"" emphasizing the need for collective strength from Europe, the U.S., and other partners. Kyiv is increasingly concerned about U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs recent criticism of Zelenskiy and a U.S.-Russia meeting in Riyadh that excluded Ukraine.

Comex Gold futures holds above $2,927/oz after a 1.5% drop in the previous session, staying near a one-week low as investors took profits. Despite the fall, concerns over President Trump‚Äôs tariff policies and global trade uncertainty continue to support gold‚Äôs upside momentum.

US consumer confidence plunges, posting its sharpest decline in 3.5 years, while 12-month inflation expectations surge. Persistent inflation could force the Fed to maintain higher interest rates, dampening gold‚Äôs appeal, though fears of a global trade war from Trump‚Äôs tariffs keep demand for safe-haven assets strong.

LME Copper recovered to trade above $9,510/ton today after slipping below $9,400 in the previous session as Trump orders an investigation into tariffs on copper imports to boost US production. This move is seen as an effort to counter China‚Äôs dominance in the copper market, with the metal being crucial for EVs, military applications, and industrial production.

WTI oil trading near two-month lows near $69 per barrel despite US crude stockpiles fell by 640,000 barrels, according to API data. If confirmed by EIA data, this would mark the first inventory drop since mid-January. Moreover, concerns over deteriorating U.S. consumer sentiment and improving prospects for a Russia-Ukraine peace deal are headwinds for curde oil prices.

Nymex natural gas surges 4.5% to $4.17/MMBtu on Tuesday, driven by strong LNG exports and tightening stockpiles despite record production levels. Storage remains 11% below the five-year average. Today, it is down about 1.5% due to fluctuating output in the Lower 48 states and warmer-than-expected March forecasts that may impact future demand.

Investors await the US PCE report, the Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation gauge, set for release on Friday. This report will provide insights into the Fed‚Äôs rate-cut trajectory and broader monetary policy outlook.

2025-02-26,"**Russia and US to hold new talks on Thursday in Turkey, Lavrov says**

Russian and U.S. diplomats are set to meet in Istanbul on Thursday to address bilateral disputes, a key step in broader efforts to resolve the Ukraine conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated that discussions will focus on improving conditions for diplomats in both countries, following tensions over staffing and embassy properties.

This meeting follows a call between Presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump on February 12 and a high-level U.S.-Russia dialogue in Saudi Arabia on February 18. While Trump seeks a swift ceasefire in Ukraine, Putin has emphasized the need to rebuild trust before making significant progress.

Beyond diplomatic issues, both nations are exploring business opportunities, with Moscow proposing U.S. participation in rare earth extraction projects in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories. Trump's policy shift toward engagement with Russia, reversing Biden-era sanctions, has raised concerns in Kyiv and among European allies that they could be marginalized in potential negotiations.

The future of weapons shipments remains under discussion.
Negotiations are taking place against a backdrop of heightened volatility in commodity markets. 

Crude oil prices are particularly sensitive to geopolitical instability, and any shifts in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including potential peacekeeping deployments, could trigger price fluctuations.

The agreement‚Äôs focus on mineral resources suggests potential long-term impacts on supply chains and market dynamics for specific commodities. The coming weeks will reveal the deal's final form and its subsequent influence on the global landscape.

This meeting, following a Trump-Putin phone call and a Saudi Arabia diplomatic session, signals a shift from the ""below zero"" relations under the Biden administration. 

The talks, held at the U.S. consul general's residence, aimed to initiate a dialogue, though expectations were tempered by both sides. Trump's pursuit of a swift resolution to the Ukraine war has raised concerns among Ukraine and its European allies regarding potential compromises. 

The Kremlin emphasized the necessity of rebuilding trust before substantive agreements can be reached, acknowledging the complexity of the issues. While immediate breakthroughs are unlikely, the meeting represents a significant effort to re-establish communication channels between the two nations.

2025-02-27,"President Donald Trump on Thursday said that his proposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada will go into effect on March 4, and that China will be charged an additional 10% tariff on the same date.

The sweeping 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada had been paused on Feb. 3 for one month. But the Trump administration has recently sown confusion about whether they would go back into effect when the delays expired. In a¬†Truth Social post¬†Thursday morning, Trump clarified that they would.

China, which already faces U.S. tariffs on its products, will be charged an additional 10% tariff on the same date, Trump said in a Truth Social post.

The announcement appeared to contradict a timeline laid out on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box‚Äù by White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett.

He claimed that illicit drugs ‚Äúare still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,‚Äù despite pledges from both U.S. neighbors to boost their efforts to police their borders.

‚ÄúWe cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,‚Äù Trump wrote.

He also announced that China, which already faces 10% U.S. tariffs on its products, ‚Äúwill likewise be charged an additional 10% Tariff on that date.‚Äù

2025-02-28,"**Trump, Zelenskiy to clinch minerals deal at White House meeting **

(Reuters)

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is set to meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House to finalize a strategic agreement granting American companies access to Ukraine's vast mineral resources. The deal, negotiated over recent days, aims to strengthen economic ties but notably lacks explicit U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, a key concern for Kyiv as it continues its war against Russia. Trump, advocating a swift resolution to the conflict and improved U.S.-Russia relations, asserts that American business presence in Ukraine itself serves as a form of security assurance.

The agreement stipulates that Ukraine will allocate 50% of revenues generated from the monetization of state-owned natural resource assets to a jointly managed U.S.-Ukraine reconstruction fund. However, the specifics regarding the fund‚Äôs utilization and the exact assets covered remain unclear. Trump has projected potential earnings in the hundreds of billions of dollars, while Zelenskiy has cautioned against any arrangement that could burden Ukraine with long-term financial obligations.

This diplomatic engagement provides a crucial opportunity for Zelenskiy to solidify U.S. support ahead of Trump's anticipated discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kyiv hopes the agreement will not only reinforce economic cooperation but also sway Republican lawmakers to approve additional military aid. As Ukraine continues to expand its defense industry, securing international assistance remains vital in its ongoing efforts to counter Russian aggression.

Reuters 

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that tariffs on Mexico and Canada will take effect on Tuesday, though the final rate will be determined by President Donald Trump. Speaking on Sunday Morning Futures, Lutnick indicated that while a 25% tariff had been planned, the administration remains flexible on the exact level.

Lutnick acknowledged improvements in border security efforts by both countries but cited ongoing concerns over fentanyl trafficking into the U.S. Trump had previously introduced uncertainty by mentioning an April 2 deadline but later reaffirmed the Tuesday implementation. Additionally, he plans to double existing 10% tariffs on Chinese goods unless Beijing halts fentanyl exports.

This marks a significant shift in U.S. trade policy, with potential economic and diplomatic implications for North American partners and China. The final decision on tariff levels will depend on negotiations in the coming days.

Reuters 

The fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has deteriorated, marked by renewed Israeli military actions in Rafah and Khan Younis, resulting in fatalities and injuries. 

This escalation has triggered heightened tensions and fears of a complete collapse of the truce, exacerbated by Israel's imposition of a total blockade on Gaza. 

The blockade has severely restricted vital supplies, causing rapid depletion of essential goods and soaring prices, amplifying humanitarian concerns. 

The increased Israeli military presence and reported gunfire near Gaza's borders have further fueled anxieties of renewed conflict. 

This instability carries significant implications for commodity markets, potentially driving up gold prices due to increased safe-haven demand and impacting crude oil prices through regional geopolitical uncertainty. The resumption of hostilities could trigger volatile price fluctuations in both assets.

Reuters 

U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed new tariffs, escalating trade tensions with the country‚Äôs top three trading partners. Effective Tuesday, a 25% tariff now applies to imports from Canada and Mexico, while duties on Chinese goods have doubled to 20%. The move follows Trump‚Äôs assertion that these nations have not done enough to curb fentanyl and precursor chemical exports fueling the opioid crisis.

China responded immediately, announcing 10%-15% tariffs on select U.S. imports from March 10, along with new export restrictions on designated American entities. 

Canada and Mexico, long beneficiaries of tariff-free trade with the U.S., have also pledged swift retaliation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed immediate 25% tariffs on C$30 billion ($20.7 billion) of U.S. goods, with further measures if tariffs remain. 

Meanwhile, Ontario Premier Doug Ford warned of potential cuts to nickel exports and electricity transmission. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum is expected to announce Mexico‚Äôs countermeasures shortly.

2025-03-04,"**Silver Industrial Demand on Track to Post New Record**

(The Silver Institute) 

The silver market is poised for its fifth consecutive year of deficit in 2025, driven by robust industrial demand projected to surpass 700 million ounces for the first time. This surge is fueled by record growth in photovoltaics, electronics, and ethylene oxide production.  Despite strong demand, concerns about the Chinese economy are tempering price increases.

**Global silver demand** is expected to remain stable at 1.20 billion ounces, with physical investment also rising by 3%.  However, a potential decline in Indian demand due to high local prices could offset some gains.

**On the supply side**, global silver supply is forecast to increase by 3% to 1.05 billion ounces, an 11-year high. This is attributed to a 2% rise in mine production, reaching 844 million ounces, and a 5% increase in recycling, exceeding 200 million ounces for the first time since 2012.

Despite headwinds from a stronger dollar and US Treasury yields, investor sentiment towards silver has improved in early 2025.  

Looking ahead, geopolitical and economic uncertainties, coupled with concerns about US public debt, could further bolster silver investment as a safe-haven asset. 

**Overall, the silver market outlook is positive,** supported by strong industrial demand and rising investment interest.  However,  the Chinese economy and potential Indian demand weakness remain key factors to monitor.

Reuters 

China swiftly retaliated against new U.S. tariffs on Tuesday, imposing levies on $21 billion worth of American agricultural and food products, alongside export and investment restrictions on 25 U.S. firms. The move escalates tensions between the world‚Äôs two largest economies, edging closer to a full-scale trade war.

Beijing‚Äôs response follows U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs 10% tariff increase on Chinese goods, now totaling 20%, citing insufficient action on drug trafficking. China dismissed the claims, calling them ‚Äúblackmail,‚Äù but set its tariff hikes below 20%, signaling room for negotiation. The measures target key U.S. exports, including soybeans, corn, pork, and dairy, while new restrictions impact U.S. firms dealing in dual-use technologies and arms sales to Taiwan.

Analysts warn of broader economic disruptions, with U.S. inflation risks and China‚Äôs post-COVID recovery at stake. Meanwhile, alternative markets like Brazil and Australia could benefit as trade realigns amid ongoing tensions.

2025-03-05,"The dollar dropped to a four-month low of 104.4 today after US private payrolls data missed estimates by a large margin, raising concerns about an economic slowdown. ADP reported that companies added only 77,000 jobs in February, far below the upwardly revised 186,000 in January and below the 148,000 consensus estimate by Dow Jones.

The dollar extended losses for a third consecutive session on Wednesday, amid growing worries that Trump‚Äôs tariffs could increase prices and slow down growth, heightening the risk of stagflation. Meanwhile, services activity expanded at a solid pace last month, pushing the PMI to 53.5, better than the 52.9 forecast. Conflicting data could complicate the Fed‚Äôs policy path, although markets remain largely confident of a rate cut in June.

2025-03-06,"The Great Reset: De-Dollarization and the Rise of a New Global Order:


For over a year, we‚Äôve been highlighting a seismic shift in the global financial order‚Äîone that‚Äôs set to be extremely painful for the U.S. economy. The era of unchecked dollar printing, which fueled a 70-year dominance, is coming to an end. De-dollarization isn‚Äôt just a policy shift; it‚Äôs the dismantling of a system that granted the West unparalleled financial privilege.

As the world pivots toward a multipolar economic order, led by BRICA (Bharat, Russia, Israel, China, and America), the consequences are clear:

Western nations will face a permanent erosion of wealth and purchasing power, forced to devalue their currencies and slash living costs just to stay competitive.

In contrast, the East‚Äîled by BRICS+ nations‚Äîwill witness a sustained rise in wealth and influence, shaping the next phase of global economic leadership.


This is not just an economic realignment; it‚Äôs a reset of everything we know‚Äîtrade, currencies, industries, and power structures.

The road ahead? Wildly volatile. Expect major disruptions, unforeseen opportunities, and historic market moves.

Interesting times ahead. Buckle up.

Russia's Defense Ministry reported that 343 drones were intercepted, including 91 over Moscow and 126 near Kursk, where Ukrainian forces are retreating. The attack preceded U.S.-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia aimed at ending the war.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin confirmed this as the most significant drone assault on the city, home to over 21 million residents. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov credited preventive measures for mitigating damage, though some residential areas were hit. Kyiv targeted Russian oil facilities overnight, while Russia labeled the attacks as strikes on civilian infrastructure.

With the war intensifying, Colonel General Andrei Kartapolov suggested retaliatory strikes using the ""Oreshnik"" hypersonic missile. As both nations refine drone warfare, Putin has condemned Ukrainian strikes on civilian sites, vowing a response.

2025-03-12 13:19:00.666 GMT

(MT Newswires)

Gold rose early on Wednesday as the dollar declined after a report showed U.S
consumer prices advanced less than expected last month, while safe-haven
buying continues amid fresh U.S. tariffs on aluminum and steel.

Gold for April delivery was last seen up US$7.20 to US$2.928.10 per ounce.

The rise follows the release of the February Consumer Price Index (CPI) from
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that showed inflation slowed to a 2.8%
annualized rate last month, down from 3.0% in January and under the FactSet
consensus estimate for a rise of 2.9%. Core CPI, excluding volatile food and
energy prices, rose 3.1%, down from 3.3% a month earlier and less than the
consensus estimate for a 3.2% rise.

The drop shows the U.S. has yet to feel any inflationary effect from U.S.
President Donald Trump's tariff policies, with 25% levies on imports of steel
and aluminum taking effect today. A similar tariff on goods imported from
Canada and Mexico will kick in on April 2 should Trump not back off again.

""Gold ... continues to attract haven demand amid Trump's fluctuating tariff
plans, recession worries and the recent dollar weakness,"" Saxo Bank noted.

The dollar was lower following the inflation report, with the ICE dollar index last seen down 0.21 points to 103.63, the lowest since Nov. 5. Treasury yields rose, with the U.S. two-year note last seen paying 4.005%, up 5.4 basis points, while the yield on the 10-year note was up 4.5 points to 4.33%.",telegram,neutral,0.7919876575469971,0.06604210116386414,0.06604210116386414,-0.7619558,0.7351,1.0,1.0,0,0

COMEX spot gold gained 0.77% to $2,939 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures rose 0.8% to $2,944.50.

Concerns persist that aggressive tariffs could drive inflation higher in the long run. U.S. inflation slowed to 2.8% y/y in February, down from 3% in January. The CPI rose 0.2% m/m. Core CPI, excluding food and energy, rose 3.1% annually and 0.2% monthly.

Following the inflation report, the U.S. dollar weakened, with the ICE Dollar Index falling to 103.50. Treasury yields edged higher, with the two-year note at 4.005% and the 10-year at 4.33%. Markets now await PPI and jobless claims data. Meanwhile, President Trump‚Äôs tariffs on steel and Aluminium imports took effect, prompting swift European retaliation.

2025-03-12,"Stocks erased gains while bond yields
climbed as Canada fired back on tariffs of US goods, keeping
traders anxious about the path for the world‚Äôs largest economy
despite a cooldown in the latest inflation data.
Equities were little changed, following an earlier advance
that drove the S&P 500 up 1.3%. That was after Canada announced
new 25% counter-tariffs on about C$30 billion ($20.8 billion) of
US-made items, following the Trump administration‚Äôs decision to
go ahead with global levies on imports of steel and aluminum.
While the consumer price index rose at the slowest pace in
four months, several measures still indicate that inflation is
rearing back up again. And with President Donald Trump rolling
out a series of tariffs, prices are expected to rise on a
variety of goods from food to clothing, testing the resilience
of consumers and the broader economy.
‚ÄúToday‚Äôs cooler-than-expected CPI reading was a breath of
fresh air, but no one should expect the Fed to start cutting
rates immediately,‚Äù said Ellen Zentner at Morgan Stanley Wealth
Management. ‚ÄúThe Fed has adopted a wait-and-see posture, and
given the uncertainty of how trade and immigration policy will
impact the economy, they‚Äôre going to want to see more than one
month of friendly inflation data.‚Äù
The S&P 500 was little changed. The Nasdaq 100 climbed
0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8%. Tesla Inc. led
gains in megacaps. Intel Corp. jumped about 6%. IRobot Corp., a
consumer robotics company, plunged 37% after raising a
‚Äúsubstantial doubt‚Äù about its ability to continue operating.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced one basis point to
4.29% A dollar gauge rose 0.1%. Germany‚Äôs benchmark yields are
close to hitting 3% for the first time in almost 18 months as
expectations of an historic debt issuance surge weighs on the
securities.
The CPI increased 0.2% after a sharp 0.5% advance in
January, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Excluding
often volatile food and energy categories, the so-called core
measure rose 0.2% as well. The BLS said nearly half of the
advance in the overall measure was due to shelter, but it still
decelerated from the prior month.
‚ÄúIt shows that inflation is moving in the right direction,
which is a nice setup as the market starts to prepare for a
potential resurgence of inflation from tariffs,‚Äù said Skyler
Weinand at Regan Capital.
To David Russell at TradeStation, a June Fed cut is still
on the table because inflation continues to moderate, especially
the key shelter category.
‚ÄúThe White House and the Fed are breathing a sigh of relief
because tariffs didn‚Äôt filter through to consumer prices,‚Äù he
said. ‚ÄúThis is a positive for investors because a huge amount of
negativity is priced into stocks. For the first time in several

2025-03-14,"**Putin suggests US ceasefire idea for Ukraine needs serious reworking**

Reuters 

Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed conditional support for a U.S.-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine, emphasizing that hostilities could not be paused until key conditions were addressed. 

Speaking at the Kremlin, Putin acknowledged the ceasefire‚Äôs merit but insisted it must lead to lasting peace and resolve the root causes of the conflict. His demands include Ukraine abandoning NATO ambitions, Russian control over occupied territories, restrictions on Ukraine‚Äôs military size, sanctions relief, and a Ukrainian presidential election.

Putin's remarks signal openness to negotiations with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has positioned himself as a peacemaker. However, Moscow and Washington continue to view the war as a high-stakes proxy conflict with global implications. 

While Trump welcomed Putin‚Äôs response as ""very promising"" and expressed willingness for direct talks, the Russian leader's conditions suggest that any ceasefire agreement may take longer to materialize than Trump anticipates.

Investors turned to gold as uncertainty over U.S. trade policies deepened, with mixed signals from Trump administration officials stoking fears of a trade-induced recession.

While U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed recession concerns, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested it was a necessary cost to implement trade policies. This divergence accelerated a sell-off in U.S. equities, prompting investors to seek refuge in gold and the Japanese yen. The European Union‚Äôs retaliatory 50% tax on American whiskey exports led President Trump to threaten a 200% tariff on European wine and spirits, further exacerbating inflation fears and boosting gold prices.

Meanwhile, U.S.-Russia ceasefire negotiations added to market uncertainty. President Putin signaled openness to talks but insisted on addressing the conflict‚Äôs root causes. Investors are also monitoring upcoming U.S. inflation data and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs policy decision next week.

Based on price action and swing analysis, MCX Silver has convincingly breached its key Q1 2025 resistance at ‚Çπ98,500, reinforcing its bullish momentum, reinforcing the bullish outlook. Now, the key upside target projections are at ‚Çπ101,700 and ‚Çπ105,000. A sustained breakout above these levels could propel prices toward ‚Çπ111,800.

Conversely, failure to hold above any of the resistances may trigger a pullback toward ‚Çπ98,500. Below this, ‚Çπ95,200 and ‚Çπ91,600 serve as critical support zones. In case of deeper corrections, ultimate support lies at ‚Çπ89,500 and ‚Çπ88,500. Overall, the trend remains bullish unless key support levels are breached.

WTI crude oil also gained momentum and rose 1% to $67.48/bbl, fueled by tighter sanctions on Iran and Russia, along with diminishing hopes for a swift end to the Ukraine war. The U.S. imposed sanctions on Iran‚Äôs Oil Minister, Mohsen Paknejad, and further restricted payment options for Russian energy companies, intensifying global supply concerns. The Trump administration also allowed a license for energy transactions with Russian financial institutions to expire this week.

Base metals remained supported by a weaker dollar and expectations of Chinese policy measures to boost domestic demand. However, sharp gains may be limited as President Trump warned of retaliatory actions after the EU imposed its own tariffs in response to the U.S. 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

China‚Äôs gold market remained strong in February, driven by robust investment demand. Between January 27 and February 28, the LBMA Gold Price PM rose by 3.4%, while the Shanghai Benchmark Gold Price PM (SHAUPM) gained 4.3%. 

However, seasonal factors led to a decline in wholesale gold demand, with Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) withdrawals falling 27% month-on-month to 90t. Weak gold jewelry sales, in tonnage terms, continued to weigh on overall demand.

Chinese gold ETFs saw record inflows, adding RMB14bn (US$1.9bn), boosting total AUM to RMB89bn (US$12bn). Holdings surged by 21t to 131t, reaching all-time month-end highs. Meanwhile, the People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBoC) expanded its reserves by 5t, marking four consecutive months of purchases, bringing total holdings to 2,290t (5.9% of reserves).

Looking ahead, investment demand is expected to remain strong, while gold jewelry consumption may stabilize if prices hold steady and economic conditions improve.

When you benchmark equity performance against gold (real money) instead of fiat currency, the true picture emerges. Much of the so-called ""wealth creation"" in equities could simply be a byproduct of inflation‚Äîor in simpler terms, the devaluation of paper (fiat) currencies.


üìå The same phenomenon applies in the US: If an American had invested in a Gold ETF instead of the S&P 500, the outcome would reveal the relentless erosion of purchasing power since 1971‚Äîthanks to unchecked money printing.

U.S. President Donald Trump has announced ""powerful"" and ""decisive"" military strikes against the Houthis in Yemen, citing their disruption of global shipping and threats to maritime security. He attributed the ongoing attacks to previous inaction, emphasizing that no U.S.-flagged commercial ship had safely sailed through key waterways for over a year. Trump warned the Houthis to cease hostilities immediately and urged Iran to halt its support, vowing severe consequences for any further aggression.

The airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, have resulted in 31 deaths and over 100 injuries, according to Houthi health officials. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi condemned the U.S. action, rejecting demands to withdraw support for the Houthis and accusing Washington of war crimes. Hamas also denounced the attacks, calling them a violation of Yemen‚Äôs sovereignty.

Meanwhile, Iran‚Äôs IRGC commander Hossein Salami warned of ""decisive and conclusive"" retaliation if provoked, though he ruled out initiating war.

Elsewhere, geopolitical tensions continue to escalate. In Russia, a Ukrainian drone strike injured two civilians in Belgorod. In Gaza, an Israeli drone strike killed nine people, including a journalist. The IDF also reported the elimination of two Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged stronger sanctions against Russia, blaming Moscow for delaying a ceasefire proposal.

Amid growing tensions, Egypt‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned Israel‚Äôs renewed strikes, urging all parties to exercise restraint and allow mediators to work toward a permanent ceasefire.

2025-03-18,"**Trump to hold call with Putin on moves to end Ukraine war**

U.S. President Donald Trump will hold a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, aiming to secure Russia‚Äôs agreement to a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine. Ukraine has already accepted the truce, marking a potential step toward ending the three-year conflict that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and displaced millions since Russia's 2022 invasion.

While Putin previously expressed conditional support for the ceasefire, he insisted that key issues must be resolved before halting hostilities. Trump, emphasizing the urgency of ending the war, has hinted at a broader peace plan that could involve territorial concessions by Kyiv and control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed Ukraine‚Äôs commitment to the truce, stating that Washington now seeks a similar pledge from Russia. The call, scheduled between 9‚Äì11 a.m. ET, will be open-ended, with both leaders discussing the next steps toward a potential resolution.

Explosions were reported in Ukraine‚Äôs Kiev region amid an air raid alarm, according to Obshchestvennoye Novosti. Shortly after, Strana reported a second wave of blasts, followed by a third series in quick succession. Several Ukrainian regions, including Vinnytsia, Dnipropetrovsk, Zhytomyr, Kiev, Kirovograd, Poltava, Sumy, Kharkiv, Cherkasy, and Chernihiv, remain under high alert.

Meanwhile, Yemen‚Äôs Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi warned of intensified attacks on Israel in retaliation for renewed Israeli strikes on Gaza. He accused Israel, with U.S. support, of committing genocide and pledged to resist any American response to Houthi actions.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan strongly condemned Israel, labeling it a ""terror state"" and vowing to hold it accountable for its actions in Gaza. He emphasized Turkey‚Äôs commitment to halting Israeli operations and restoring regional peace.

Additionally, Iran-backed Houthis launched a ballistic missile at Israel, which the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) intercepted before it crossed the border. This marks the first Houthi attack on Israel since January 18, following their earlier ceasefire warning.

While the PCE price index has moderated to 2.5%, it remains above the Fed's 2% objective. Market probabilities, as indicated by the CME FedWatch Tool, strongly favor rate stability at this meeting, though a June rate cut is increasingly priced in.

Current economic headwinds include declining consumer spending and diminished confidence, evidenced by elevated inflation expectations. The potential for a trade-induced inflationary surge, stemming from newly announced tariffs, presents a critical policy dilemma. The Fed's commitment to price stability necessitates vigilance against inflationary pressures, potentially tempering near-term growth considerations.

The forthcoming economic projections from the FOMC later today at 11:30 pm IST will provide crucial insights.

2025-03-20,"Copper prices have surged above $10,000 per tonne, with U.S. traders paying a record premium over London prices due to concerns over potential U.S. tariffs on copper imports. The price gap between New York Comex and LME copper has widened to over $1,254 per tonne as traders rush to secure supply before tariffs take effect.
**

Key Drivers:**

Tariff Threat: President Trump has launched a probe into copper imports, with a possible 25% tariff on the horizon.

Supply Tightening: Copper stocks are being drawn out of LME warehouses and redirected into U.S. Comex facilities, driving prices higher.

Global Demand Factors: Increased infrastructure spending in Germany, Chinese economic stimulus, and growing investor interest in metals are further fueling the rally.

Smelter Challenges: Low processing fees are squeezing global copper smelters, with Glencore already shutting its Philippines facility.

**
Market Implications & MCX Impact**

The ongoing tariff uncertainty has also led to a sharp rise in MCX copper prices. The Comex-LME spread needs to be closely monitored‚Äîif it expands towards $2,000‚Äì$2,500, it could further tighten global supply, pushing copper prices even higher on LME and MCX. Conversely, a sudden contraction in the premium could trigger a sharp correction in copper futures on both MCX and LME.

**
Technical Outlook ‚Äì MCX Copper**

Bullish Above ‚Çπ890: As long as copper holds above ‚Çπ890, the uptrend remains intact, with potential targets at ‚Çπ940 and ‚Çπ950.

Caution Below ‚Çπ890: A break below this level could signal weakness, warranting a cautious approach.

Stay alert to further developments in the tariff situation, as it could significantly impact copper prices in the coming weeks.

 The Committee reaffirmed its commitment to achieving maximum employment and returning inflation to the 2% target over the long run, emphasizing increased uncertainty in the economic outlook.

In line with its policy strategy, the Fed will continue reducing its balance sheet but will slow the pace of Treasury security runoff, lowering the monthly redemption cap from $25 billion to $5 billion starting in April. The cap for agency debt and mortgage-backed securities remains at $35 billion. The Fed remains vigilant in assessing economic data and risks to determine future policy adjustments.

Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged rising economic uncertainty, noting that some inflationary pressures stem from tariffs. He reiterated the Fed‚Äôs readiness to adjust policy as needed to support economic stability. The decision was largely unanimous, with Christopher J. Waller dissented, favoring a continued pace of balance sheet reduction.

At least 70 Palestinians were killed and dozens injured in Israeli airstrikes across Gaza as Israel resumed its military operations, a Gaza health official reported. Following the collapse of a ceasefire that had held since January, Israeli ground forces advanced into northern Gaza, targeting Beit Lahia and expanding the Netzarim corridor. Hamas retaliated by launching rockets into Israel, prompting further escalations.

Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy discussed ending Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine in a ""fantastic"" phone call. Trump briefed Zelenskiy on his conversation with Vladimir Putin, who rejected a full ceasefire but agreed to halt attacks on Ukraine‚Äôs energy infrastructure. Amid ongoing hostilities, a prisoner exchange was facilitated by the UAE, with 175 troops freed on both sides.

Bullion traded just roughly $20 below Thursday‚Äôs record

gripped markets amid mounting worries about an escalation in the
US-led trade war. The precious metal has benefited as the White

though the exact scope isn‚Äôt clear. 
Gold has climbed 16% this year in a rally that‚Äôs seen it hit 15 all-time highs in 2025, extending last year‚Äôs strong gains as investors seek safety. Geopolitical conflicts in the
Middle East and Ukraine have also bolstered the metal‚Äôs appeal.
Several major banks have raised their price targets for bullion
in recent weeks, with Macquarie Group forecasting it could rise
as high as $3,500 an ounce.

US sentiment remains fragile, even as reports on Thursday
showed existing home sales topped estimates, while initial
jobless claims were in line with expectations ‚Äî a sign of a
healthy labor market. That‚Äôs had investors considering the path
ahead for monetary easing by the Federal Reserve, after
policymakers on Wednesday kept interest rates on hold and

However, gold posted a 0.64% weekly gain, extending its bullish trend for a third straight week, supported by geopolitical tensions and expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts.

Precious metals retreated as the dollar index surged to a two-week high, and Treasury yields rose, triggering long liquidation. Hawkish remarks from New York Fed President Williams and Chicago Fed President Goolsbee reinforced steady Fed policy, weighing on metals. COMEX Silver hit a 1.5-week low amid concerns that U.S. trade policies could slow economic growth and reduce industrial metal demand.

Despite near-term pressures, gold has recorded 16 all-time highs this year, peaking at $3,065.2 per ounce. Escalating Middle East tensions and renewed U.S. strikes in Yemen continue to bolster safe-haven demand, while stock market weakness further supports bullion prices.

World Gold Council 

In India, domestic landed gold prices surged 17% YTD to a record INR 88,946/10g, partly due to INR depreciation (1.3% YTD). However, weak jewellery demand has kept domestic prices at a discount, averaging $12/oz in March, slightly narrower than February‚Äôs $17/oz spread. Despite record highs, gold remains India‚Äôs best-performing asset with a 13% YTD return, significantly outperforming domestic equities and fixed-income investments.

**Elevated prices have dampened jewellery demand**, limiting purchases to essential needs such as weddings. Fiscal year-end obligations, including tax-saving investments, have further restrained discretionary spending. The surge in prices has also driven higher sales of old gold, with retailers reporting that up to one-third of their sales stem from jewellery exchanges. Additionally, loans against gold jewellery rose sharply, with commercial banks‚Äô retail gold loans increasing 77% y/y as of January.

The United States and Russia held high-stakes talks in Saudi Arabia on Monday, focusing on a potential ceasefire in Ukraine, with Washington prioritizing a Black Sea maritime agreement as an initial step. This followed U.S. discussions with Ukrainian officials a day earlier, as President Donald Trump accelerates efforts to resolve the three-year conflict. His recent calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Russian President Vladimir Putin signal a diplomatic push toward de-escalation.

The proposed maritime ceasefire aims to restore secure shipping routes, reviving a 2022 agreement that Moscow argued failed to meet its expectations. While Trump has praised Putin‚Äôs engagement, European leaders remain skeptical, citing Russia‚Äôs unchanged territorial demands and insistence on Ukraine renouncing NATO aspirations.

2025-03-24,"**Trump says countries that purchase oil from Venezuela will pay 25% tariff on any trade with U.S.**

President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on countries purchasing Venezuelan oil and gas, effective April 2, in a bid to pressure President Nicol√°s Maduro and curb China‚Äôs influence in Venezuela‚Äôs energy sector. The move directly impacts China, which imported 270,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, making it Venezuela‚Äôs largest customer. The U.S. was the second-largest buyer at 233,000 bpd, followed by India and Spain.

Oil markets responded swiftly, with WTI crude rising 1.20% to over $69.30 per barrel and Brent climbing 1.12% to $72.99. Analysts anticipate further price increases if Trump follows through on the policy.

Trump also accused Venezuela of sending Tren de Aragua gang members to the U.S., designating the group a foreign terrorist organization. Meanwhile, he is reconsidering an extension for Chevron‚Äôs Venezuelan operations, balancing geopolitical pressure with domestic energy interests ahead of the Treasury‚Äôs April 3 deadline.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz approved new operational plans for continued military action against Hamas in Gaza. Following discussions with senior military officials, including Southern Command chief Yaniv Asor and Gaza Division commander Barak Hiram, Katz reiterated that securing the release of hostages remains Israel's primary objective. He warned that Hamas would face increasing military pressure if it continues to resist, with further territorial losses, targeted eliminations of operatives, and destruction of infrastructure. 

Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry accused Ukraine of launching drone attacks on Russian energy infrastructure, targeting key facilities in Crimea, Lugansk, and Krasnodar.

In Syria, Israeli forces struck Kuya village near Dara, killing at least five people. The IDF stated that the attack was a response to armed militants firing at Israeli forces. Additionally, Israel bombed the Tadmur and T-4 air bases for the second time in a week.

The United Kingdom remains committed to its security partnership with the United States despite recent US war plan leaks. Prime Minister Keir Starmer‚Äôs spokesperson reaffirmed the UK's confidence in its intelligence security and its continued cooperation with Washington on defense, particularly in the Middle East.

Meanwhile, diplomatic tensions persisted between Russia and Ukraine during US-Russia talks in Riyadh. Russian Senator Vladimir Chizhov claimed Ukraine‚Äôs stance prevented a joint statement despite 12 hours of negotiations. However, he described the discussions as ""positive.""

Additionally, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov confirmed talks with US officials on Black Sea navigation. Russia expressed willingness to rejoin the Black Sea Grain Initiative, provided it receives ""clear"" guarantees, preferably from the US rather than Ukraine. The initiative, crucial for global food security, remains stalled. These geopolitical developments highlight ongoing security realignments and diplomatic challenges amid global tensions.

2025-03-26,"**Russia, Ukraine agree to sea, energy truce; Washington seeks easing of sanctions**

The United States has reached separate deals with Ukraine and Russia to suspend attacks on maritime and energy targets, marking the first formal commitments between the warring nations since President Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration. While implementation details remain unclear, these deals reflect Trump's push for a swift resolution to the Ukraine conflict, a stance that has raised concerns in Kyiv and Europe.

The U.S.-Russia agreement goes further than its pact with Ukraine, as Washington has committed to advocating for the lifting of international sanctions on Russian agricultural and fertilizer exports‚Äîa long-standing demand from Moscow. However, the Kremlin insists the Black Sea agreements will not take effect unless certain Russian banks regain access to the international financial system. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy dismissed this condition, accusing Russia of attempting to manipulate the deal‚Äôs terms.

Both Kyiv and Moscow have expressed skepticism regarding compliance, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov demanding clear guarantees from Washington. Zelenskiy warned that any violations would prompt calls for additional U.S. sanctions on Moscow and increased military aid. Despite these tensions, Trump remains optimistic, emphasizing progress in negotiations.

The agreements also include a 30-day suspension of attacks on energy infrastructure, a critical aspect of the ongoing conflict. While the maritime security deal aims to protect Ukraine‚Äôs grain exports, Russia has linked its implementation to sanctions relief, requiring further international consensus.

2025-03-27,"Copper‚Äôs near-term outlook remains bullish yet cautious, driven by supply constraints, trade policy uncertainty, and China‚Äôs economic measures. The anticipation of US import tariffs taking effect sooner than expected has fueled a surge in buying activity, pushing the Comex-LME price gap to record highs. Additionally, supply disruptions from Chile and smelter cutbacks in China have further tightened global availability, adding upward pressure on prices. On the demand front, China‚Äôs aggressive stimulus policies, including a 5% GDP growth target and large-scale infrastructure spending, are expected to bolster copper consumption. While volatility may persist due to tariff-related uncertainty and dollar fluctuations, the supply-demand imbalance point toward positive momentum in the coming months.

2025-03-27,"U.S. gold futures scaled a record peak on Thursday, as investors sought the safe-haven asset in response to escalating global trade tensions and tumbling equity markets following U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of new auto tariffs.
U.S. gold futures climbed 1.1% to $3,056.10, after hitting an all-time high of $3,065.50 earlier in the session, while spot gold rose $3,047.89 an ounce as of 09:10 a.m. ET (1310 GMT).

Gold is traditionally seen as a hedge against economic and political uncertainty and often thrives in a low-interest rate environment. Gold spot prices have hit 16 record highs this year, reaching an all-time peak of $3,057.21 on March 20.

Governments from Ottawa to Paris threatened retaliation after Trump unveiled a 25% tariff on imported vehicles, set to come into effect the day after he plans to announce reciprocal tariffs, aimed at the countries he says are responsible for the bulk of the U.S. trade deficit.

2025-03-27,"Copper, a crucial metal for the global economy, has emerged as the top performer in the metals sector this year, with LME prices recently reaching $10,165 per tonne, the highest level since June 2024. This dramatic surge, which stands in stark contrast to the performance of other base metals, has been driven by growing concerns over potential U.S. import tariffs that could worsen an already strained copper supply. Although prices have recently retreated due to profit-taking and a rebound in the U.S. dollar, the underlying fundamentals of Copper suggest that this pullback may be just a temporary dip.
**
Key Drivers behind Copper‚Äôs Surge
**
Copper‚Äôs rally to multi-month highs has been driven by fears of import tariffs that could strain the already limited capacity of US smelters. The US imports nearly half of its copper supply, relying on just two major smelters. Concerns escalated after the White House unexpectedly expanded base metal tariffs on Canada, raising speculation that copper tariffs could be implemented sooner than expected. The tariffs aim to rebuild domestic production capacity, essential for electric vehicles, military hardware, power grids, and consumer goods. Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariff policy, set to be announced on April 2, is expected to be narrower in scope than initially feared, helping to temper concerns over global trade disruptions. However, reports suggest that tariffs on copper imports could take effect within weeks, much earlier than the official 270-day deadline for the Commerce Department‚Äôs investigation.
**
Comex Copper Prices at Record Highs
**
Copper on the Comex exchange hit an all-time high of $5.39 per pound, driven by supply concerns and the rush to import the metal into the US before potential tariffs take effect. Shipment disruptions from Chile, world‚Äôs largest copper producer, have further exacerbated supply fears. Traders are diverting supply from Asia to the US to capitalize on the price premium and avoid potential tariffs, pushing US copper prices significantly above LME levels. The price gap between front-month Comex and LME contracts widened to a record $1,400/tonne in response to these developments.
**
Supply constraints and global production
**
Glencore‚Äôs Altonorte smelter in Chile temporarily halted shipments due to furnace issues, further tightening supply. The facility has an annual capacity of 349,000 tonnes.

China‚Äôs Tongling Nonferrous Metals cut its copper processing by 10% due to weak smelting fees, reflecting an oversupply of refined copper from new smelters in China, Indonesia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Zambia‚Äôs copper production rebounded 12% in 2024 to 820,676 metric tons, up from 732,583 tons in 2023, supporting global supply. However, the overall supply-demand balance remains tight due to increasing demand for electrification and renewable energy projects.
**
Inventory Trends and market tightness
**
LME and Shanghai inventories are declining, with 100,000 to 150,000 metric tons of refined copper expected to arrive in the US in the coming weeks.

LME canceled warrants, an indicator of physical demand, have risen to 49% of total available stocks, signaling robust demand for immediate delivery.

ShFE inventories, however, have surged over 200% since the start of 2025, reflecting an ample supply in China. This has pressured Chinese smelters to keep treatment charges below zero, highlighting overcapacity in the refined copper market.
**
China‚Äôs economic stimulus and copper demand
**
China‚Äôs latest stimulus measures have boosted demand expectations in the world‚Äôs largest copper consumer. Premier Li Qiang announced a 5% GDP growth target for 2025 and authorized local governments to issue 4.4 trillion yuan in special-purpose bonds to fund infrastructure and development projects. The policy package includes measures to increase household income, stimulate spending, and support population growth, reinforcing optimism for stronger industrial demand.",telegram,negative,0.6042791604995728,-0.24696010932604473,-0.24696010932604473,-0.5812269,0.0516,0.11111111111111112,1.0,0,1

2025-03-31,"**COMEX Gold futures surged past $3,100 per ounce for the first time on Monday, driven by escalating concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff policies, economic uncertainty, and heightened geopolitical risks**.

Spot gold also reached a record high of $3,106.50 per ounce, underscoring strong investor demand for the safe-haven asset.

Bullion has posted multiple record highs this year, rising over 18% as investors seek protection against inflation, economic instability, and geopolitical turmoil. Earlier this month, gold breached the psychologically significant $3,000 per ounce level, a milestone that analysts attribute to persistent global uncertainties. 

The rally has led several major financial institutions to revise their price forecasts upward. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and UBS have all raised their gold price projections. Goldman now expects prices to reach $3,300 per ounce by year-end, up from $3,100. Bank of America forecasts $3,063 per ounce in 2025 and $3,350 per ounce in 2026, significantly increasing its previous estimates.

Trump‚Äôs tariff strategy, including a proposed 25% duty on imported automobiles and additional levies on Chinese goods, continues to fuel market uncertainty. A new round of reciprocal tariffs is set to be announced on April 2, which analysts believe will further bolster gold‚Äôs appeal.

Additionally, strong central bank demand and rising inflows into gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) provide further support for bullion‚Äôs rally, reinforcing its status as a hedge against global economic and geopolitical risks.

2025-03-31,"**China‚Äôs factory activity expands at fastest pace in a year, official survey shows
**
China‚Äôs manufacturing sector expanded at its fastest pace in a year in March, signaling the effectiveness of Beijing‚Äôs stimulus measures amid growing trade tensions with the U.S. The official Purchasing Managers‚Äô Index (PMI) rose to 50.5, up from 50.2 in February, indicating continued expansion after a contraction in January. The non-manufacturing PMI also improved, reaching 50.8 from 50.4.

Policymakers have intensified monetary and fiscal support to achieve a 5% growth target, including consumer stimulus programs and accelerated government debt issuance to address housing and deflation concerns. However, economic indicators remain mixed, with industrial output and investment exceeding expectations, while consumer inflation turned negative and exports slowed.

Trade tensions are escalating as U.S. President Donald Trump imposed 20% additional tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting Beijing‚Äôs retaliatory tariffs on U.S. energy and agricultural products. Trump is set to announce further tariffs on April 2, though he signaled potential reductions if China facilitates the sale of TikTok‚Äôs parent company. Meanwhile, the Caixin/S&P Global PMI is expected to rise to 51.1 from 50.8 due on Tuesday.

economy and demand for raw materials. Gold steadied after
hitting a fresh record high.
The levies were seen as more aggressive than expected, with
a 10% duty on all exports to the US and even higher rates on
about 60 nations. While a swath of commodities ‚Äî including
energy, steel and aluminum - were exempted, there are mounting
concerns about a broader hit to consumption, with major trading
partners China and the European Union both vowing countermeasures. 

Brent crude futures fell as much as 3.6% in London, benchmark European gas touched a three-week low and copper shed
as much as 2.2%. Soybeans dropped on worries American crops will suffer from retaliatory measures, and cotton plunged by the exchange limit.

‚ÄúThe tariffs were bigger than expected,‚Äù said Giovanni
Staunovo, a commodity analyst at UBS Group AG. ‚ÄúThe question now
is how other nations will respond, including whether we will see
stimulus measures.‚Äù

2025-04-03,"Base metals witnessed a sharp decline as President Trump‚Äôs sweeping tariffs rattled global markets. Copper fell to multi-week lows on the LME and Comex, driven by concerns that higher tariffs would slow global growth and industrial demand. Aluminum prices also hit a six-month low as trade tensions escalated.

Trump imposed the highest U.S. import taxes in a century, including a 34% levy on Chinese goods. While copper, aluminum, and steel were excluded for now, an ongoing investigation into copper tariffs adds to market uncertainty. Additionally, the U.S. implemented a 25% duty on imported vehicles, further straining trade relations. 

The newly announced reciprocal tariffs set a 10% baseline duty on imports, with steeper levies on key trade partners‚ÄîChina (54%), the EU (20%), Japan (24%), and India (26%). Although base metals were left out of immediate tariff hikes, potential actions under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act could impact future pricing and supply chains. 

While the exclusion of base metals offers temporary relief to buyers, uncertainty lingers. With escalating trade tensions and economic disruptions, base metal prices are expected to remain volatile in the near term.

The growing preference for gold ETFs is driven by their liquidity, transparency, cost-effectiveness, and ease of trading compared to physical gold.

Gold‚Äôs status as a ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù asset has further strengthened investor interest, especially amid rising geopolitical uncertainties. Unlike physical gold, ETFs eliminate concerns related to storage, purity, and theft, making them a more convenient and secure investment avenue. This trend underscores the growing appeal of gold ETFs in uncertain economic conditions.

2025-04-04,"**Global Markets Sink as Trade War Fears Escalate**

A risk-off sentiment swept through global markets on Friday, triggered by heightened fears of a full-blown trade war between the U.S. and China. Investors scrambled for safety as China announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, deepening concerns that the escalating trade tensions could push the global economy into a recession. Commodities, including Copper and Crude oil, took a massive hit, with both falling more than 5%, reflecting mounting concerns of slower global growth.

The U.S. stock markets followed suit, suffering another day of heavy losses as fears about the tariffs and their potential to stifle global growth weighed heavily on investor sentiment. 

The extended market sell-off followed China‚Äôs Commerce Ministry revealing that it would impose a 34% tariff on all U.S. products, matching the tariff rate imposed by President Trump earlier this week on Chinese imports.

Meanwhile, the much-anticipated U.S. jobs report presented a mixed picture. Nonfarm payrolls exceeded expectations, adding 228,000 jobs in March, but the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4.2% from 4.1%. Despite the better-than-expected jobs numbers, the global markets largely ignored the data as concerns over the escalating trade war rhetoric continued to dominate, with fears of further disruptions on the horizon.

WTI Crude Oil prices plunged by 8% on Friday, nearing their lowest levels since the 2021 pandemic lows, as escalating U.S.-China trade tensions rattled global markets. It dropped $7.5, or 10.80%, to $60.80‚Äîmarking their steepest weekly declines in over two years. 

China‚Äôs announcement of a 34% tariff on U.S. goods from April 10, in retaliation to new U.S. levies, fueled fears of a full-scale global trade war, dampening economic growth prospects and energy demand. 

Further pressure came from OPEC+‚Äôs decision to accelerate its production increase to 411,000 bpd in May, up from the previously planned 135,000 bpd. 

Although energy imports remain exempt from U.S. tariffs, the broader trade policy is expected to spur inflation, slow economic activity, and weigh on commodity prices.

2025-04-07,"**US starts collecting Trump's 10% tariff, smashing global trade norms**

President Trump's unilateral 10% tariff on a wide array of imports has commenced, marking a significant departure from established international trade norms. This initial phase, effective Saturday, impacts numerous countries, including Australia, Britain, and Brazil, despite existing U.S. trade deficits with some. The move is characterized by trade experts as a ""seismic shift,"" potentially reshaping global commerce.

Further escalating the situation, higher ""reciprocal"" tariffs, ranging from 11% to 50%, are scheduled for Wednesday, targeting major economies such as the European Union and China with 20% and 34% levies, respectively. These actions have already triggered substantial market volatility, erasing trillions in stock value and fueling recession concerns.

Global responses vary considerably. China has retaliated with its own tariffs and export restrictions, while European leaders, like President Macron, advocate for unity against protectionism. British Prime Minister Starmer seeks to shield domestic businesses and pursue trade deals, and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is set to discuss the new tariffs with Trump directly. Japan, facing a 24% levy, is attempting to negotiate via telephone. Vietnam, previously a beneficiary of supply chain shifts, has agreed to trade talks after a 46% tariff announcement. Taiwan is actively strategizing with tech executives against a 32% duty.

Despite exemptions for certain product categories, the administration is considering expanding the tariff scope. Billionaire Elon Musk has expressed support for a zero-tariff U.S.-Europe trade relationship, while Canada and Mexico, though exempt from the latest measures, still grapple with existing tariffs. This trade policy shift signals a period of heightened econonmic uncertainty and potential global trade restructuring.

There‚Äôs growing noise in the bond market ‚Äî the 3-year SOFR swap spread has plunged into negative territory. What does this mean and why should you care?


**üîç Quick Refresher ‚Äî What is a 3Y SOFR Swap?**

It‚Äôs an interest rate swap with a 3-year maturity. One side pays a fixed rate, the other pays a floating rate tied to SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate).


**üîÑ SOFR vs LIBOR ‚Äî What‚Äôs the Difference?**


SOFR is based on actual overnight borrowing backed by U.S. Treasuries in the repo market. It‚Äôs seen as a nearly risk-free rate.

LIBOR (now phased out) was based on bank estimates and had credit risk baked in.
In short: SOFR = real transactions, LIBOR = bank opinions.


üìè** What‚Äôs the 'Swap Spread'?**

It‚Äôs the difference between the fixed rate in the SOFR swap and the yield on a Treasury of the same maturity.
For example:

If 3Y SOFR swap fixed rate = 3.80%
And 3Y Treasury yield = 4.20%
Then swap spread = -0.40% (or -40 bps)
Normally, this spread is slightly positive. A deep negative means something‚Äôs breaking.

**
üßÆ What‚Äôs the Basis Trade & How‚Äôs the Basis Calculated?

**Hedge funds love this strategy:

Buy Treasury bonds (cash market)

Short Treasury futures or use swaps (derivatives market)

Borrow cash in the repo market to fund the position
They profit from the price difference ‚Äî called the basis ‚Äî between the bond and its future.
Basis = Bond price - Adjusted Futures price (including funding cost, carry, etc.)
It‚Äôs often small, so they use massive leverage (10x‚Äì20x) to juice returns.


**üí£ What could have gone Wrong?**

Repo borrowing costs rose

Treasury yields spiked

The basis turned negative or too tight

So funds unwound the trade, selling Treasuries (yields up) and entering more swaps (fixed rates down) ‚Äî leading to the collapse in swap spreads.


üö®** Why This Matters**

This is a symptom of funding market stress and a broader liquidity squeeze. Hedge funds and leveraged players are being forced to deleverage, triggering sharp moves in rates and credit.

The Fed may be forced to act ‚Äî via repo support or even a liquidity injection ‚Äî if this worsens.


**üìä Watch these indicators:**

3Y and 10Y SOFR swap spreads

Repo rates

Treasury futures basis

Dealer balance sheets


**üìå Bottom Line:**
When swap spreads go negative, it‚Äôs not just a technicality ‚Äî it‚Äôs a sign of market stress under the hood.


**(Traders and investors with real experience of 2008 US financial crises and 2011-12 European debt crises will know how important are credit markets)**

Immediate key trendline resistance near 89300. A decisive break above the same is likely to push prices towards 89800 mark which could act as a supply zone in the near term. A fresh round of selling is expected near this mark. 

However, 90400 mark will be the critical resistance. A break above 90400 will invalidate the bearish view and is likely to start a fresh rally towards all time highs.

Traders are advised to keep watch on these key levels for next few trading sessions.

2025-04-09,"**Gold prices climb 2% as US tariffs take effect, dollar wavers
**
Gold prices surged nearly 2% on Wednesday as the U.S. dollar weakened following the implementation of fresh U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting investors to seek refuge in safe-haven assets amid heightened global trade tensions and recession fears. 

Spot gold rose 1.9% to $3,038.54 an ounce as of 0700 GMT, while U.S. gold futures advanced 2.2% to $3,056.60.

The dollar index (.DXY) fell, making dollar-denominated gold more attractive to overseas buyers. President Donald Trump escalated trade measures by raising tariffs on Chinese goods to 104%, accusing Beijing of currency manipulation to offset the levies. In response, China rejected the move as ‚Äúblackmail‚Äù and vowed to ""fight to the end."" The country-specific tariffs came into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET (0401 GMT) as scheduled.

Despite recent volatility, gold remains on track to test new all-time highs amid persistent global growth and inflation uncertainties. Gains in the non-yielding metal were capped by a rise in U.S. 10-year Treasury yields to a one-month high. 

Gold hit a record $3,167.57 on April 3, drawing parallels with the 1980 rally during the Iranian Revolution.

Gold ETFs saw the largest quarterly inflows in three years during Q1 2025, according to the World Gold Council. Market participants now await the Fed minutes and U.S. CPI data for further cues. 

Among other metals, spot silver gained 1.3% to $30.23, platinum held at $921.62, and palladium rose 0.9% to $914.73.

2025-04-09,"The European Union on Wednesday voted to approve its first set of retaliatory measures to counter tariffs imposed by the U.S. on steel and aluminum.

The European Commission, the bloc‚Äôs executive arm, said duties would start being collected from April 15. The response package was unveiled last month targeting a range of goods.

The 27-nation bloc had warned it would act to protect European business and consumers after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed 25% duties on the metals. The EU also faces tariffs of 20%, along with over 180 countries and territories, as announced by the White House leader on April 2.

‚ÄúThe EU considers US tariffs unjustified and damaging, causing economic harm to both sides, as well
 as the global economy. The EU has stated its clear preference to find negotiated outcomes with the
 US, which would be balanced and mutually beneficial,‚Äù the European Commission said.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the time said the EU was ready to retaliate unless negotiations with the U.S. administration were successful.

‚ÄúWe are prepared to respond,‚Äù she said, adding that the EU was preparing for further countermeasures to protect its interests and businesses. But, von der Leyen also called for talks with the U.S., saying it was ‚Äúnot too late to address concerns through negotiations.‚Äù

Maros Sefcovic, the EU‚Äôs commissioner for trade and economic security, said Monday that the bloc would start collecting a first tranche of tariffs on U.S. imports from April 15, with a second set of measures following on May 15.

The U.S. tariffs are impacting 380 billion euros ($420.45 billion) worth of Europe‚Äôs exports to the United States, amounting to around 70% of total exports, Sefcovic said during a press briefing.

2025-04-09,"**Oil prices plummet on China's retaliation against US tariffs**

Crude oil prices plunged sharply on Wednesday, with WTI falling as much as 7% to fresh four-year lows of $55.12 per barrel before partially recovering. 

The selloff was triggered by China‚Äôs announcement of steep retaliatory tariffs against the U.S., escalating trade tensions. Beijing will now impose tariffs of up to 84% on U.S. goods, up from the previously announced 34%, in response to President Trump‚Äôs 104% tariff on Chinese imports, which took effect earlier the same day.

Brent crude futures trading near $60.50 a barrel, while WTI near $57.60. Both benchmarks had lost up to 7% intraday before paring losses. 

Analysts fear that the deepening U.S.-China trade war could tip the global economy into recession, thereby weakening oil demand. Giovanni Staunovo of UBS noted that while demand hasn‚Äôt yet declined, the risk of oversupply looms, requiring price adjustments to balance the market.

Meanwhile, the European Union is set to approve its own countermeasures, joining China and Canada in opposing U.S. tariffs. 

Rystad Energy‚Äôs Ye Lin warned that China‚Äôs oil demand growth‚Äîestimated at 50,000 to 100,000 bpd‚Äîmay slow if the trade war persists, though domestic stimulus could offset some of the impact.

Adding further pressure, OPEC+ plans to raise output by 411,000 bpd in May. Goldman Sachs forecasts Brent and WTI to average $62 and $58 per barrel by December 2025. 

However, a surprise draw of 1.1 million barrels in U.S. crude inventories offered a glimmer of support to prices.

Skymet Weather, a leading private meteorological agency, has projected a ‚Äònormal‚Äô southwest monsoon for 2025, estimating rainfall at 103% of the Long Period Average (LPA) of 868.6 mm for the June‚ÄìSeptember period. The forecast carries a model error margin of ¬±5%, aligning with the classification of ‚Äònormal‚Äô rainfall (96‚Äì104% of LPA). This bodes well for the agricultural sector and offers prospects for moderating food inflation in FY26.

Jatin Singh, Managing Director of Skymet, emphasized that El Ni√±o conditions‚Äîtypically associated with monsoon disruption‚Äîare unlikely this year. Instead, a neutral El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phase is expected to prevail. The remnants of La Ni√±a, combined with ENSO-neutral conditions, are anticipated to provide a stabilizing influence on the monsoon.

Additionally, a neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) with a likelihood of turning positive is forecasted to synchronize with ENSO conditions. Historically, such a combination has supported favorable monsoon patterns. Skymet anticipates a stronger second half of the season compared to the initial phase.

Regionally, western and southern India are expected to receive good rainfall, with surplus showers likely along the Western Ghats, particularly in Kerala, Coastal Karnataka, and Goa. Adequate rainfall is also forecasted for core rainfed regions like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. However, below-normal rainfall is expected in Northeast India and hilly regions of North India.

Probability estimates indicate a 40% chance of normal monsoon, 30% for above-normal, and 10% for excess rainfall. The likelihood of a drought is minimal at just 5%. Month-wise projections suggest improving rainfall trends from June (96%) to August (108%).

2025-04-10,"Gold rose again after levy chaos Drives Biggest Gain in 18 months (Bloomberg)

Gold rose again after posting its biggest one-day gain in 18 months, as confusion over US President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff agenda drove investors to buy the precious metal as a haven.

Bullion climbed as much as 1.6% on Thursday and was trading less than $50 short of last week‚Äôs all-time high. That‚Äôs after it closed up 3.3% on Wednesday in a whipsaw day for markets. The precious metal has also been supported by a weaker greenback.

Gold‚Äôs initial surge in the previous session came after US tariffs on around 60 trading parters kicked in, fueling market upheavals and increasing worries about a global recession. Then Trump announced a 90-day pause to higher tariffs on 56 countries and the European Union, which will now be taxed at the 10% baseline rate.

Still, Trump also hiked duties on China to 125%, effective immediately, after the Asian country announced plans to retaliate with an 84% tariff to start Thursday. Those moves are exacerbating concerns the world‚Äôs two biggest economies will become enmeshed in a crippling trade war.

Markets rallied after Trump‚Äôs tariff-pause announcement. US stocks had their best day since the financial crisis, with the S&P 500 soaring nearly 10%, after slumping to the fringe of a bear market in the past week.

The constant back-and-forth of the US administration‚Äôs tariff plan has rocked the world, as investors scramble to find direction and certainty. That‚Äôs generally been supportive for gold, which is up 18% this year. The metal has also been bolstered by hopes for more Federal Reserve monetary easing and central-bank buying.

The U.S. raised tariffs on Chinese imports from 104% to 125%, with the effective rate reaching 145% when including a 20% levy on fentanyl. 

China retaliated with an 84% tariff on U.S. goods, intensifying fears of a prolonged trade standoff.

The dollar also faces a broader confidence crisis as U.S. trade realignments weaken its reserve currency status, prompting some foreign investors to offload dollar holdings. 

Soft March CPI data, with headline inflation at 2.4% y/y and core at 2.8% y/y‚Äîboth below expectations‚Äîreinforced dovish sentiment for Fed policy. 

Despite a modest rise in initial jobless claims, falling continuing claims pointed to labor market resilience. Rate cut odds for May declined to 25% from 35% last week.

MCX Copper futures held firm above ‚Çπ830 per kg on Thursday, maintaining much of their rebound after dipping below ‚Çπ790 earlier this week‚Äîa three-month low. 

The recovery followed President Trump‚Äôs announcement of a 90-day pause on his reciprocal tariff package, which initially excluded copper but introduced a 10% levy on non-retaliating countries. This policy shift eased recession concerns in the U.S., supporting expectations of stronger manufacturing demand. 

However, copper remains over 10% below its March 26 record high of ‚Çπ922, as Trump signaled forthcoming tariffs specifically targeting copper. This uncertainty has widened the premium of U.S. copper futures over LME contracts, reflecting market concern over strained U.S. smelting capacity.

 Additionally, escalating U.S.-China trade tensions have disrupted copper scrap flows, further complicating global supply dynamics.

Think of it like a messy divorce: the US and China are the bride and groom, and the rest of the world? Just the relatives caught in the crossfire.

For de-dollarisation to truly take root, de-globalisation must precede it. And for de-globalisation to play out meaningfully, a hard economic decoupling between the US and China is inevitable. Only then can regionalism thrive in its full form.

We‚Äôre living through the slow but seismic shift of an 80-year-old world order. These are fascinating times, where the tectonic plates of global power, trade, and currency are quietly but surely moving.

2025-04-14,"**Trump‚Äôs escalating tariff measures: a timeline of trade disruptions**

Since President Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration, a wave of tariff announcements has reshaped global trade dynamics, prompting swift and varied responses from affected countries.

The initial move came on 1 February, with the imposition of a 25% tariff on exports from Canada and Mexico, and a 10% levy on Chinese goods. This triggered immediate negotiations, with Mexico and Canada securing a one-month reprieve by 3 February. On 10 February, the U.S. expanded its trade barriers with a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports. The tariff on Chinese imports was increased to 20% on 4 March.

While exemptions were introduced intermittently‚Äîsuch as the 5 March suspension of the 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican carmakers and broader exemptions announced on 7 March‚Äîby 12 March, the steel and aluminum tariffs took full effect.

The White House‚Äôs most aggressive move came on 2 April, with Trump announcing ""reciprocal tariffs"" of up to 50% on select countries and a general 10% levy on all other imports. By 9 April, a list of 60 ‚Äúworst offenders‚Äù faced increased tariffs, though a 90-day pause was granted‚Äîexcluding China, which saw tariffs soar to 125%, and 145% for fentanyl-linked products.

China retaliated sharply with 84% tariffs on 10 April, followed by a 125% rate effective from 12 April. While China stated it would not respond to further U.S. measures, exemptions persist, notably for small parcels under $800, taxed at $75 per item until 2 May, then rising to $150 after 1 June.

Canada and Mexico remain partially exempt, with ongoing delays and adjustments for energy and industrial goods.

**On April 12, the Trump administration exempted smartphones, computers, and select electronics from its sweeping tariffs, including the 125% levy on Chinese imports. The move marks the first major reprieve in the U.S.-China trade war, potentially signaling a strategic shift in tariff policy.**

2025-04-14,"President Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested Sunday that the reciprocal tariff exemptions for some electronics may be short-lived, and said separate tariffs for these products are ""coming soon.""

""They're exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they're included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,"" Lutnick said Sunday on ABC News' This Week.

Lutnick's comments throw cold water on hopes that popular tech products made in China, such as computers, laptops, smartphones, and flat-panel TVs, would be spared from Trump's 145% reciprocal tariffs ‚Äî duties that raise prices for U.S. importers and are generally passed on to consumers.

The U.S. Customs and Border Protection late Friday evening announced exemptions for smartphones, computers, and other tech devices and components from his reciprocal tariffs.

Lutnick on Sunday emphasized that the U.S. ""can't be beholden and rely upon foreign countries for fundamental things that we need.""

""So this is not like a permanent sort of exemption. [Trump's] just clarifying that these are not available to be negotiated away by countries,"" he said Sunday.

Lutnick added: ""These are things that are national security that we need to be made in America.""

The reciprocal tariff exemptions had brought a sigh of relief, at least for now, for tech companies, including Apple, which manufactures many of its products in China.

But Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said the confusion sowed by the Trump administration's reversal late Friday on reciprocal tariffs on some electronics from China ‚Äî and his sudden call on Wednesday for a 90-day pause in enforcing new tariffs on other countries ‚Äî is harmful to the U.S.

2025-04-16,"**China Open to Talks If Trump Shows Respect, Names Point Person**

China wants to see a number of steps from
President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration before it will agree to
trade talks, including showing more respect by reining in
disparaging remarks by members of his cabinet, according to a
person familiar with the Chinese government‚Äôs thinking.
Other conditions include a more consistent US position and
a willingness to address China‚Äôs concerns around American
sanctions and Taiwan, said the person, who asked not to be
identified to discuss internal thinking. 
Beijing also wants the US to appoint a point person for
talks who has the president‚Äôs support and can help prepare a
deal that Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping can sign when they
meet, the person said. 
The fate of the global economy and financial markets hinges
in large part on whether the US and China can find a way to
avoid a protracted trade war. Trump has hit China with tariffs
of 145% on most goods since taking office, prompting Beijing to
retaliate and threatening to wipe out most trade between the
world‚Äôs biggest economies. 
The rapid onslaught of US tariffs has engendered broad
public support in China for retaliation, giving Xi a political
incentive to rebuff Trump‚Äôs repeated demands for a phone call.
The US leader on Tuesday again called on China to reach out to
him in order to kick off negotiations to resolve the trade
fight. (Bloomberg)",telegram,positive,0.5186983942985535,0.1284943085384369,0.1284943085384369,-0.06365138,0.8016,0.0,1.0,0,0

2025-04-16,"**Lower silver demand and higher supply to reduce global deficit by 21% in 2025**

The global silver market is projected to witness a narrowing deficit of 21% in 2025, reaching 117.6 million troy ounces, driven by a 1% decline in demand and a 2% rise in total supply, according to the Silver Institute. 

Despite this moderation, silver will mark its fifth consecutive year of structural market deficit, largely due to robust industrial use in electronics, EVs, and solar panels. 

Industrial demand is expected to remain steady at the 2024 record of 680.5 million ounces, while jewellery and silverware consumption is likely to decline. 

Investment demand is set for a modest recovery, with silver coin and bar demand forecasted to rise 7% after a steep 22% drop in 2024, which had pushed volumes to a five-year low. The U.S. saw the sharpest 46% decline, attributed to elevated prices, saturation, and post-election reactions to Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential victory.

Spot silver prices have risen 12% YTD, following a 21.5% gain in 2024.

Silver‚Äôs dual role as a precious and industrial metal faces demand headwinds in 2025 amid recession fears, geopolitical tensions, and a weakening global outlook. Elevated U.S. tariffs and escalating trade wars may further pressure industrial, jewellery, and silverware demand by disrupting global supply chains and hindering economic growth.

2025-04-17,"The CBIC has revised the base import price of gold to $1,032 per 10 grams, marking the first time it has crossed the $1,000 threshold.

This base price, fortnightly revised based on global market trends and currency fluctuations, serves as the reference for levying import duties. The tariff was recently increased by $48 per 10 grams from the previous fortnight. This significant revisions of over $40 happened for the second consecutive fortnight reflects ongoing volatility in global gold prices, driven by macroeconomic uncertainty, a weaker dollar, and renewed trade tensions. The tariff levels at this time last year were $773 per 10 grams.

Global safe-haven demand for has intensified amid escalating geopolitical concerns and shifting U.S. trade policy. As a result, gold prices have surged, with COMEX gold breaching the $3,371 level and MCX gold fast approaching Rs 96,000 per 10 grams.

2025-04-17,"**MCX CRUDEOIL VIEW:**
¬†
On 4th¬†April, we had shared a bearish view on Crude Oil when prices breached below its long term triangular formation. We witnessed a sharp fall of more than 800 points after this breakdown. However, price has managed to recover from the lows of 4798 and currently trading near 5400 mark. Going forward, the previous breakdown level i.e.¬†**5600 mark**¬†will act as¬†**critical resistance.**¬†A decisive¬†**break above 5700**¬†mark will be considered as a¬†**reversal in the trend.**
¬†
The RSI (14) on weekly chart is still trading below the 40 mark which signals that counter still lacks the strength in momentum.¬†**The critical support**¬†is now placed at¬†**5180**¬†mark. A decisive break below this level is likely to resume the next round of selling in the counter which could be accelerated towards 4500 mark in the medium term. If prices break¬†**above 5700**¬†mark on daily closing basis, the¬†**bearish view will invalidate.**
**¬†**
**Overall, we expect Crude Oil to trade in a wide range of 5180 ‚Äì 5700 as long as we get a break on either side of this range.**

2025-04-21,"The gold-to-silver ratio has surged above 104.5, highlighting silver‚Äôs deep undervaluation relative to gold. Historically, such extremes have preceded sharp silver rallies‚Äîas seen during the early COVID-19 period when silver outpaced gold three-to-one. Ratios above 104 are rare, typically observed during crises like the Great Depression, and tend to mean-revert toward 70, suggesting substantial upside potential.

While President Trump‚Äôs aggressive tariff measures‚Äîranging from a 10% base to 145% on Chinese imports‚Äîhave raised concerns over industrial demand, analysts believe this drag is largely priced in. Silver‚Äôs dual role as a monetary and industrial metal may now tilt toward its safe-haven appeal amid rising geopolitical risks.

Meanwhile, the Silver Institute projects a 2025 supply of 1.031 billion ounces against 1.148 billion ounces in demand‚Äîmarking a fifth consecutive deficit. Tight inventories further reinforce silver‚Äôs bullish long-term outlook.

COMEX gold futures surged to a record high on Monday, touching an all time high of  $3,418.3 /oz amid a weakening dollar and escalating concerns over a global economic slowdown, triggered by rising U.S.-China trade tensions. 

COMEX Spot gold also rose 2.40% to $3,406.65/oz to an all-time high.

Investor appetite for safe-haven assets grew as President Donald Trump's broad tariff measures and unpredictable trade stance rattled global markets and dimmed the U.S. economic outlook.

Additionally, Trump‚Äôs recent criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell contributed to the dollar index falling to a three-year low of 97.9, making dollar-denominated gold more attractive to overseas buyers.

China‚Äôs warning against countries aligning economically with the U.S. further amplified uncertainty. 

COMEX Gold, up over $700 since early 2025 due to heightened geopolitical and macroeconomic risk.

Don't lose sight of the script of de-dollarisation as you follow headlines. 

Most get confused with headlines because they have not understood the  SCRIPT  in geo economics and it's impact on geo politics.


Script is de dollarisation and De globalisation. Another way of saying it is, from unipolar world order to multi polar world order. 

It will be chaotic and full of drama. 

And the core of this reset will be a complete divorce between US citizens and Chinese businesses. 

The former is the consumer out of printed dollars and latter, the producer against those printed dollars. 

A lot of misdirection is likely. The truth and diplomacy are like water and oil, they never mix.

2025-04-23,"Brent has surrendered earlier gains, and
more declines are likely in store over supply dynamics.

Kazakhstan has defied OPEC+ by prioritizing national
production targets over group quotas, a move that exposes
growing fractures within the alliance.

That comes as the IEA warns of tepid demand growth,
especially from China, and an expanding global supply glut. The
agency sees production outpacing consumption by a wide margin
this year, which could force prices even lower in the absence of
new shocks.

Meanwhile, Iran‚Äôs state oil company is slashing crude
prices to Asia and Europe, and in some cases flipping premiums
into discounts, in a bid to maintain export flows despite
sanctions. That adds another layer of downside pressure to
global benchmarks.

There have been some short-term bullish signals, including
a draw in US crude stockpiles, Brent‚Äôs prompt spread hitting its
strongest level since January, and an improvement in the macro
risk sentiment that‚Äôs also propelling stocks.

Still, the broader trend seems bearish for oil. Brent
remains some 10% below pre-tariff levels and could struggle to
reclaim those highs unless demand surprises to the upside,
something the IEA says is increasingly unlikely. (Bloomberg)",telegram,neutral,0.9554470181465149,0.02975567025214434,0.02975567025214434,-0.0017286595,0.1531,0.0,1.0,0,0

2025-04-25,"Gold prices fell 2% on Friday and were en route for a weekly dip as the dollar rose and signs of easing U.S.-China trade tensions after a report that Beijing has exempted some U.S. goods from its tariffs weighed on bullion.

Spot gold was down 1.9% at $3,284.13 an ounce as of 09:10 a.m. EDT (1310 GMT). Bullion is down 1.2% for the week.

U.S. gold futures slipped 1.6% to $3,294.50.

""The apparent detente on tariffs is negatively affecting gold prices ... But so far we've not seen substantial liquidations,"" said TD Securities commodity strategist Daniel Ghali.

""However, we know that they've continued to buy the dip over the last few sessions, so we think gold can resume its upward trajectory.""

China is considering exempting some U.S. imports from its 125% tariffs and is asking businesses to identify goods that could be eligible, according to businesses notified.

Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested a de-escalation of their tit-for-tat tariff battle, saying direct talks were already underway.

The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, rose and was on track for its first weekly gain since March, making bullion more expensive for overseas buyers. [USD/]

Gold, traditionally seen as a hedge against geopolitical and economic uncertainties, scaled a record high of $3,500.05 per ounce and has gained more than 25% so far this year, owing to US-China trade tensions and strong central bank demand.

""Trade war concerns were the main reason behind all the prior gold buying. But it could still be a while before we see actual progress and so those concerns are not completely gone just yet,"" said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com.

Elsewhere, spot silver slipped 1.1% to $33.21 an ounce, but was heading for its third straight weekly gains.

Oil prices fell on Thursday, extending a steep decline the previous session due to indications that Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, could increase production and data showing a contraction in the U.S. economy, the world's top oil consumer.

""The oil market remains concerned about weakening oil demand growth over the coming months due to the trade tensions as well as a faster unwinding of the OPEC+ production cuts,"" said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.
Saudi Arabia is telling allies and industry experts that it is unwilling to prop up the oil market with supply cuts and can manage a prolonged period of low prices, sources told Reuters.
Several OPEC+ members will suggest the group accelerates output hikes in June for a second consecutive month, three people familiar with OPEC+ talks have said. Eight OPEC+ countries will meet on May 5 to decide a June output plan.

Meanwhile, the U.S. economy contracted for the first time in three years in the first quarter, swamped by a flood of imports as businesses raced to avoid higher costs from tariffs and underscoring the disruptive impact of President Donald Trump's unpredictable trade policy.
Trump's tariffs have made it probable the global economy will slip into recession this year, a Reuters poll suggested.
""The U.S. administration's volatile tariff policy strategy, especially those involving China, has made traders that were already skittish on the longstanding oversupply this year nervous about loosening fundamentals."" MUFG analyst Ehsan Khoman said.

A demand outlook clouded by trade disputes coupled with an OPEC+ decision to increase supply will weigh on oil prices this year, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.
Analytics firm Kpler has lowered its 2025 global oil demand growth forecast to 640,000 barrels per day from 800,000 bpd, citing the China-U.S. trade war and weak Indian demand.

However, a more accurate reading of the original Chinese text indicates otherwise. It outlined three key points: first, that the U.S. has made repeated overtures to resume dialogue over the past week; second, that China is still assessing the situation; and third, that substantive talks would only be possible if the U.S. first corrected its ‚Äúwrongdoings‚Äù as a demonstration of sincerity‚Äîfailing which, China would remain resolute in its stance. 

Rather than signaling a shift in policy, the statement appears to be a formal diplomatic response to U.S. outreach. Given the apparent misreading by markets, a clarification from Chinese authorities may follow. The ongoing rally in risk assets, particularly in equities, may therefore be vulnerable to reversal. Notably, gold‚Äôs resilience‚Äîrising instead of falling on the news‚Äîsuggests that gold traders are seeing through the headline-driven optimism and positioning defensively.

2025-05-02,"**Copper rebounds amid inventory drawdown and trade war
**
LME copper prices experienced significant volatility this week, initially dropping over 3% after hitting three-week highs. However, the metal rebounded sharply, recovering most of its losses and is now poised to register a fourth straight weekly gain. A stronger US dollar had initially pressured prices, but sentiment improved after China reaffirmed its 5% growth target and indicated upcoming support measures in the next quarter.

Additional support for the market came from a record drop in copper inventories at the Shanghai Futures Exchange, which fell by 54,858 tons, the largest weekly decline on record indicating strong physical demand in the world‚Äôs top consumer. Despite broader global trade uncertainties, including escalating US-China tariff tensions, Chinese buyers have driven up import premiums and spot prices, signaling tight market conditions.

In contrast, weak manufacturing data from both China and the US dampened sentiment, reflecting trade war-induced demand headwinds. Weak Chinese manufacturing data, with the PMI hitting a 16-month low, and a surprise contraction in US GDP (-0.3% annualized in Q1) reignited concerns over global growth. Additionally, an expected copper oversupply, with the International Copper Study Group forecasting a surplus of nearly 500,000 tons in 2025‚Äì26, has weighed on long-term bullish expectations.

Amid the volatility, potential signs of easing US-China trade tensions provided some relief to the market. Reports suggest that China is evaluating the possibility of trade negotiations, while the US has indicated a willingness to engage. Despite this, short-term price momentum continues to be underpinned by shrinking inventories and persistent supply-side risks. Investors remain focused on forthcoming economic indicators and trade-related developments for guidance in an increasingly delicate market landscape.

A recent report also showed that China has begun exempting certain U.S. goods from tariffs to ease the economic burden of the trade war. This is also supporting gains in oil and base metals.

Gold for June delivery was last seen up US$73.50 to US$3.396.10, nearing the

The rise comes on solid physical demand for gold, particularly from China,

States carries out a trade war with nearly all its trading partners.

2025-05-06,"**Gold and Silver Rally Again in Asian Session Amid Accumulation by Regional Buyers**


Once again, gold and silver have moved higher during the Asian trading session, driven by steady accumulation from Asian buyers.


**A Key Point on Gold Demand Dynamics**


Gold demand can broadly be segmented into three categories:


1Ô∏è‚É£ **__Jewellery demand ‚Äì primarily from individuals.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Monetary demand ‚Äì from central banks, institutions, and increasingly, retail investors seeking currency alternatives.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Speculative demand ‚Äì through ETFs and leveraged financial instruments.__**


Over the past 3‚Äì4 years, the surge in demand from central banks and institutions‚Äîlargely motivated by de-dollarisation efforts‚Äîhas become the primary driver of gold prices. Speculators have amplified price movements, adding volatility but not fundamentally altering the trend.


Jewellery demand, once a dominant force, has increasingly taken a back seat and is now playing catch-up.


In our view, this structural shift is likely to persist. As the U.S. reportedly aims to repatriate more of its gold reserves to Fort Knox ahead of a possible revaluation or audit, and other central banks and sovereign institutions prepare for a multipolar world order, we anticipate the emergence of a digitally linked, gold-backed, multi-currency global monetary system. This evolving framework will likely elevate gold‚Äôs strategic role well beyond traditional jewellery use.

**
Our Takeaway for Traders**

It is important for traders and investors not to be overly swayed by short-term narratives surrounding rising or falling jewellery demand. While it may influence prices at the margin, the core long-term driver of gold remains monetary demand in the context of a shifting global financial architecture.

2025-05-08,"U.S. President Donald Trump's administration on Thursday imposed sanctions on a third Chinese independent - or ""teapot"" - oil refinery, and port terminal operators in China for purchases of Iranian oil.

The U.S. Treasury designated the Hebei Xinhai Chemical Group refinery and three companies for operating a terminal at Dongying Port in Shandong Province. It said they had purchased or facilitated the delivery of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Iranian oil.

It ¬†was the latest independent Chinese refinery targeted by the Trump administration after it re-imposed a policy of ""maximum pressure"" that aims to cut off Iran's export revenue to pressure Tehran into a deal to curb its nuclear program and stop the funding of militant groups across the Middle East.
""So long as Iran attempts to generate oil revenues to fund its destabilizing activities, the United States will hold both Iran and all its partners in sanctions evasion accountable,"" the U.S. Treasury said in a statement.
Previous sanctions imposed on two small Chinese refiners for buying Iranian oil have created difficulties in receiving oil, leading them to halt purchases of crude and sell product under other names, sources familiar with the matter said.
Those sanctions have also begun to deter other, larger independent Chinese refiners from buying Iranian crude, three of the sources said.
Iran's U.N. mission in New York and China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The companies Treasury designated for operating the port terminal were Baogang (Dongying Donggang) Logistics and Warehousing Co, Ltd, Shandong Jingang Port Co, Ltd, and Shandong Baogang International Port Co, Ltd.
Treasury said the companies operate a terminal in Dongying Port that has received more than one million barrels of Iranian oil from shadow fleet tankers.
The sanctions block U.S. assets of those designated and prevent Americans from doing business with them. (Reuters)",telegram,positive,0.6934818625450134,0.17516155916452408,0.17516155916452408,0.21432312,0.34,0.0,1.0,1,0

2025-05-12,"The US and China have agreed on a deal to help resolve the trade war raging between the world‚Äôs two largest economies, top Trump administration officials announced Sunday.

**Details of the deal, struck during negotiations in Switzerland over the weekend, were not revealed, but officials teased that more information will be shared on Monday.**

‚ÄúThe U.S. has a massive $1.2 trillion trade deficit, so the President declared a national emergency,‚Äù US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Sunday. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us work toward resolving that national emergency.‚Äù

President Trump has imposed tariffs of up to 145% on goods from China, with China slapping retaliatory tariffs on American exports.

Greer joined Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng for the talks in Geneva, Switzerland, over the weekend to address the triple-digit tariff.

The announcement comes after the Trump administration unveiled a framework for a trade deal with the United Kingdom last week. 

China is America‚Äôs third-largest trading partner and has long drawn ire from Trump over its practices, including exporting deadly fentanyl, currency manipulation, intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and more.

2025-05-12,"**üåê US-China Trade Reset: Relief Rally or Calm Before the Storm?**


Markets have rallied on renewed optimism around US-China trade talks, following reports that the U.S. may lower its effective tariff rate on China to around 45%‚Äîsooner than previously expected. There is growing confidence in a rollback or suspension of tariffs on fentanyl (currently at 20%) and other escalatory tariffs totaling 91%. In response, China is likely to withdraw retaliatory tariffs and offer reversible concessions in key areas like fentanyl, rare earths, and purchases of U.S. goods.


**But let us not get carried away by the headlines.**


President Trump has made it clear‚Äîthis is not just about tariffs; it‚Äôs about resetting the entire relationship between the U.S. and China. The existing dynamic‚Äîwhere the U.S., as issuer of the world‚Äôs reserve currency, consumes beyond its means, and China, funded by cheap dollar inflows, produces beyond its economic fundamentals‚Äîis unsustainable. This over-leveraged, debt-driven structure is undergoing a structural reset.


The U.S. wants to re-industrialize and reduce its reliance on consumption-driven growth. For China, the transition is even more daunting: shifting from an export- and investment-led model to one driven by domestic consumption and regional trade. This transformation will be long, painful, and full of economic dislocation‚Äîfor both nations.


Amid this tectonic shift, a reduction in tariffs is necessary‚Äînot as a sign of reconciliation, but as a way to manage the economic decoupling more smoothly. Economic divorce, not reconciliation, is the underlying theme. So long as ""America First"" remains a core policy pillar, decoupling is not a risk‚Äîit is a reality.

**__
üëâ For now, traders may cheer the prospect of tariff relief.

üëâ But we caution: beneath the surface, a deeper economic storm is building.

üëâ The reset will not spare the EU either‚Äîit, too, will face collateral damage.__**


Conclusion: Enjoy the relief rally if you must, but understand that this is not the end of the trade war‚Äîit‚Äôs the beginning of a larger reset.

2025-05-12,"The US and China will temporarily lower tariffs on each other‚Äôs products, according to a joint statement released in Geneva, in a move to cool trade tensions and give the world‚Äôs two largest economies three more months to resolve their differences.

**The combined 145% US levies on most Chinese imports will be reduced to 30% including the rate tied to fentanyl by May 14, while the 125% Chinese duties on US goods will drop to 10%, according to the statement and officials in a briefing Monday.**

‚ÄúWe had a very robust and productive discussion on steps
forward on fentanyl,‚Äù Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said. ‚ÄúWe
are in agreement that neither side wants to decouple.‚Äù

The statement also said ‚Äúthe parties will establish a
mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations.‚Äù

The announcement represents a step toward de-escalating a
tariff war that has led to an immediate slump in trade across
the Pacific Ocean. The two countries had earlier reported
‚Äúsubstantial progress‚Äù in their talks, which buoyed markets and
helped Chinese stocks recoup their losses since President Donald
Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù announcement of tariffs on April 2.
Trade Representive Jamieson Greer said the US wants to have
more balanced trade with China.
The White House called the agreement a ‚Äútrade deal‚Äù in an
initial statement on Sunday, but it is still unclear what an acceptable goal is for both sides or how long it will take to get there. 

China previously demanded that the US remove all the tariffs it has imposed this year, which is incompatible with the US objective of reducing or ending the trade deficit.

While markets greeted recent reports of progress, history
suggests that it could take a long time to reach a detailed agreement, if one is possible. 

In 2018, the two sides also agreed to put their dispute ‚Äúon hold‚Äù after a round of negotiations, but the US soon backed away from that deal,
leading to more than 18 months of further tariffs and talks before the signing of the ‚ÄúPhase One‚Äù trade deal in January 2020.

In the end, China failed to live up to the purchase agreement in that deal and the US trade deficit with China jumped during the pandemic, setting up the current trade war. (Bloomberg)",telegram,positive,0.7204754948616028,0.31368687692165376,0.31368687692165376,0.111813754,-0.2111,1.0,1.0,1,0

commodities, while gold fell, after China and the US agreed to
lower tariffs following a weekend of trade talks. 

Brent crude added as much as 3.9% in London and copper rose
1.4%. European natural gas extended gains, while soybeans and iron ore also rallied. Shares of the top mining companies
surged.

The truce between the world‚Äôs two largest economies brings
relief to commodity markets roiled by prohibitive tariffs that
dented the outlook for global growth in recent weeks. Oil
watchers have slashed demand forecasts, and there are signs the
trade war is already hitting the amount of goods arriving in the
US. 

China will reduce tariffs on US goods to 10% from 125%,
while America will cut its own curbs to 30% from 145% in an
arrangement lasting for 90 days.
At a briefing after the talks, US Treasury Secretary Scott
Bessent said neither nation wanted their economies to decouple.
Both countries said they would establish a mechanism to continue
discussions on economic and trade relations.

The announcement came after a weekend of talks in Geneva
involving Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng.

The lower levies are ‚Äúreducing fears of a prolonged economic fallout hurting demand,‚Äù said Ole Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank. ‚ÄúThe key question is whether today‚Äôs news marks peak optimism, given the low likelihood of a full US retreat from its stance on China.‚Äù

We‚Äôve been echoing a similar view for some time now. As the US gradually pivots from being a consumption-driven economy to a production-oriented one, it is also, perhaps inadvertently, beginning to relinquish the privilege of having the sole global reserve currency in the form of the US Dollar.

Such monumental transitions rarely occur without turbulence. History suggests they are often accompanied by debt bubble busts and financial crises. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we may approach a critical inflection point‚Äîwhere, either in coordination with or under pressure from BRICS+ and other emerging economies, t**he US may be forced to undertake a significant devaluation of the dollar.

In remarks that focused on the central bank‚Äôs policy framework review, last done in the summer of 2020, Powell noted that conditions have changed significantly over the past five years.


During the period, the Fed witnessed a period of surging inflation, pushing it to historically aggressive interest rate hikes. Powell said that even with longer-term inflation expectations largely in line with the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, the era of near-zero rates is not likely to return anytime soon.

‚ÄúHigher real rates may also reflect the possibility that inflation could be more volatile going forward than in the inter-crisis period of the 2010s,‚Äù Powell said in prepared remarks for the Thomas Laubach Research Conference in Washington, D.C. ‚ÄúWe may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks ‚Äî a difficult challenge for the economy and for central banks.‚Äù

The Fed held its benchmark borrowing rate near zero for seven years following the financial crisis in 2008. Since December 2024, the overnight lending rate has been in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, most recently trading at 4.33%.

The ‚Äúsupply shocks‚Äù remarks are similar to those Powell has delivered over the past several weeks cautioning that policy changes could put the Fed in a difficult balancing act between supporting employment and controlling inflation.

Though he did not mention President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs in his Thursday remarks, the central bank chief in recent days has noted the likelihood that tariffs will slow growth and boost inflation. However, the extent of either impact is difficult to gauge, particularly as Trump recently has backed off the more aggressive duties pending a 90-day negotiating window.

2025-05-16,"**__Gold: The Long-Term Ascent Amid a Shifting World Order__**



Long-term outlooks carry the most weight when shared during market corrections ‚Äî especially for assets in a secular bull run, like Gold.


Since early last year, we've maintained a bullish stance on Gold, citing accelerating de-dollarisation and unprecedented central bank accumulation as structural drivers. The election of Donald Trump further strengthened our conviction. His ""America First"" doctrine isn't just nationalistic rhetoric ‚Äî it's a direct accelerant of the de-dollarisation trend. It fast-tracks the global transition from a unipolar to a multipolar economic order.


The cost of maintaining a single-country reserve currency has now far outweighed the benefits. America's policy circles are gradually embracing a pivot ‚Äî from a consumption-led model to a production-driven economy. But this shift demands a massive economic and financial reset, the pain of which will be felt on Main Street.


The key question: Will the U.S. public be willing to bear the costs?

To make ""Made in USA"" viable in a world riddled with tariffs, the U.S. may eventually have no choice but to devalue the dollar. That would mean:


A significant fall in the USD vs BRICS+ currencies


Relaxed environmental & labor regulations


Lower real wages & production costs


All of this has social implications that America hasn't yet reckoned with.


And if, during this reset, panic in global markets strengthens the dollar, it would only make U.S. manufacturing even less competitive ‚Äî making a strategic dollar devaluation not just likely, but necessary.


Bottom Line:

Gold remains one of the most compelling long-term assets.
Sharp price corrections should be viewed not with fear, but with accumulation intent.

2025-05-19,"**Gold: A Secular Bull Market Anchored in a Shifting Global Order**

The secular bull run in gold remains firmly intact, underpinned by powerful structural shifts such as accelerating de-globalisation and de-dollarisation. As the United States pivots from its long-standing role as the world‚Äôs primary consumer toward becoming a net producer, economic pain at home is set to rise. This transition comes at a time when the U.S. is already burdened with record levels of government debt, which continues to weigh heavily on long-term Treasury yields.

Traditional buyers of U.S. debt, including many BRICS+ nations, are increasingly reluctant to fund America‚Äôs fiscal deficits. The U.S.'s apparent retreat from its role as the consumer of last and first resort makes it a less attractive destination for global capital. This tectonic realignment in the global monetary system is prompting central banks, institutional investors, and individuals alike to turn to gold as a trusted monetary anchor.

The recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign credit ratings is a formal acknowledgment of the deepening fiscal challenges facing the country. As de-dollarisation accelerates, and the U.S. gradually loses its single-country reserve currency status over this decade, gold is likely to perform well in dollar terms. A significant devaluation risk looms over the U.S. dollar in the coming years‚Äîa scenario that could be highly supportive for gold prices.


**Short-Term Outlook:**

Gold remains technically bullish following a healthy 10% correction, which flushed out excessive speculative long positions. This is evident from the sharp decline in net longs in CME data as per the latest CFTC report. As long as prices hold above $3100, the bullish bias remains intact.

2025-05-20,"**A Major Story is Unfolding in Global Bond Markets**

The sharp surge in long-term government bond yields‚Äîespecially in Japan‚Äîis turning heads. Japan‚Äôs 30-year and 40-year bond yields have skyrocketed to multi-year highs, a clear sign that the era of ultra-low yields is rapidly fading. Meanwhile, U.S. long-end yields remain elevated, with the 10-year hovering above 4.4% and the 30-year near 4.9%.

This dual move is not just about inflation or growth expectations. It reflects deeper structural shifts:

In Japan, the BOJ‚Äôs yield curve control is losing grip as markets price in policy normalization.

In the U.S., rising deficits, massive refinancing needs, and fading demand from BRICS+ countries are pressuring long-duration bonds.


**Why it matters:**

This repricing of sovereign debt‚Äîespecially at the long end‚Äîhas profound implications across asset classes:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Currencies:** Rising yields can drive capital flows and impact FX volatility.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Commodities: **Cost of carry and global liquidity are sensitive to bond market shifts.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Equities:** Higher discount rates challenge valuations, especially for growth stocks.


**We are witnessing a potential regime change. This space demands close attention.**

As de-dollarisation accelerates and the U.S. dollar potentially edges closer to losing its global reserve currency status by the end of this decade, the United States could be heading towards a full-blown debt crisis. Both government and consumer debt are spiraling, with the fiscal deficit now seemingly beyond control. Any sharp reduction in government spending would likely trigger a steep decline in GDP, while higher tariffs would ultimately be borne by American consumers.

2025-05-22,"**Gold Market Update**

Comex Gold June futures fell below the $3,300 per ounce mark on Thursday, reversing earlier gains after briefly touching a two-week high of above $3,346. The decline was driven by a stronger US Dollar, which climbed over 100 following upbeat US S&P Global PMI data for May. The Composite PMI rose to 52.1 from April‚Äôs 50.6, signaling robust expansion in both manufacturing and services sectors, thereby tempering demand for non-yielding assets like gold.

Gold had recently rallied amid intensifying US debt concerns. The House approval of President Trump‚Äôs tax-cut bill, projected to add $3.8 trillion to the national debt over a decade, has raised alarms over fiscal sustainability. Moody‚Äôs downgraded the US credit rating to Aa1, citing chronic deficits and rising interest costs.

Jobless claims for the week ending May 16 came in slightly below expectations at 227K, offering modest support to the USD. Meanwhile, fears of stagflation and persistent geopolitical tensions continue to underpin gold's longer-term appeal. 

Conflicting signals on a possible Russia-Ukraine ceasefire contrasting Trump's recent optimistic social media post with his private comments to European leaders add to global uncertainty, offering underlying support for safe-haven demand.

2025-05-22,"Wall Street showed signs of stabilization just a day after a Treasury selloff that shook markets around the globe, with stocks seeing small moves amid a rebound in bonds from session lows. The dollar rose.

Following the worst equity rout in a month, the S&P 500 wavered. While most of its industries retreated, the world‚Äôs biggest technology companies saw a rally. Alphabet Inc. extended a two-day surge to about 7%. Long-term US government bonds, which had led the recent selling on concerns about the nation‚Äôs surging debt load, pared most of their earlier losses. 

‚ÄúEquities are cooling off from short-term overbought
conditions. Still, a healthy pause/consolidation phase seems
more likely than another significant decline, as market breadth
remains constructive,‚Äù said Craig Johnson at Piper Sandler.
With traders taking cues from the bond market, the still
elevated level of yields kept a lid on riskier bets. Investors
are concerned that President Donald Trump‚Äôs signature tax bill
that narrowly passed the House would boost the nation‚Äôs already
swelling deficit.

**That reinforces what many in financial markets have been
highlighting: Unless the US gets its finances in order and soon,
the perceived risks of lending to the government will increase,
and borrowing costs on long-term Treasury debt will climb even
further. That would make reducing the deficit even harder and
lift the cost of money for households and companies throughout the economy.
**
‚ÄúMarket volatility has resurfaced amid renewed uncertainty
surrounding trade policy and the fiscal outlook,‚Äù said Mark
Haefele at UBS Global Wealth Management: ‚ÄúWith bond yields
elevated and tariff and budget risks in focus, this volatility
may persist as investors monitor further developments in
policy.‚Äù

On the economic front, US business activity and output
expectations improved as trade-related anxiety eased even as
price pressures continued to mount. **In a sign of a still healthy
labor market, initial jobless claims dropped to the lowest in

West Texas Intermediate slid more than 1.5% to trade below
$61 a barrel. Brent dropped below $64, touching the lowest in a
week. If OPEC+ approves the potential increase of 411,000
barrels a day when it meets on June 1, it will mark the third

‚ÄúThe most likely outcome is another headline increase of

Crude is under pressure as the Organization of the

slower economic growth and weaker energy demand, deepening the

2025-05-23,"**Silver Spot USD ‚Äì Monthly Chart Commentary**

We‚Äôve showcased this chart before, and it‚Äôs important to keep revisiting it with updated data to stay anchored to the larger narrative unfolding in Silver. What we are witnessing is a decade-long accumulation structure‚Äîa rare and powerful base that, when it resolves, has the potential to surprise even the most optimistic bulls.

Silver has recently broken out of a classic Cup and Handle formation‚Äîone of the most reliable long-term bullish reversal patterns. However, the current consolidation zone between $28 and $35 is critical. It lies between the neckline of the Cup & Handle formation and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the 2011‚Äì2020 bear market. This retracement zone, around $35/$36, also coincides with Cluster A‚Äîa region where Silver‚Äôs 2011‚Äì2012 bear market rebounds repeatedly failed, highlighting its significance as a long-term resistance-turned-potential-launchpad.

The Cluster B zone near $28 has now acted as a support base after the breakout, affirming the structure‚Äôs strength.

This setup is not for traders seeking short- or medium-term opportunities. It is for investors who have the risk appetite, holding horizon, and conviction to remain patient for years. We believe that the breakout from this structure is setting the stage for a multi-year bull run.

**__Our base case target for the next 4‚Äì5 years is around $50, with a more aggressive projection of $75.

2025-05-26,"**The Great Monetary Reset: De-Dollarization and the Rise of a Multipolar World
**
If you‚Äôve been a regular reader of our channel, you‚Äôll know that we‚Äôve been consistent in our view: regardless of the drama surrounding Trump‚Äôs trade policies or the noise from geopolitical flashpoints, the path ahead is clear‚Äîwe are entering the final phase of de-dollarization.

This is not a passing trend or a speculative theory. It is a structural transformation of the global financial order.

The U.S. economy and financial system are approaching a historic inflection point. As the world moves away from the dollar as its primary reserve currency, we foresee a major reset‚Äîone in which the United States could lose a substantial portion of its purchasing power and the dollar‚Äôs global value could decline meaningfully by the end of this decade.

A complete economic decoupling between the U.S. and China now seems more like a matter of ‚Äúwhen,‚Äù not ‚Äúif.‚Äù The European Union may also follow suit, aligning more with emerging economic blocs and regional trade agreements that bypass the dollar.

At its core, de-dollarization represents the unwinding of U.S.-centric globalization. The world is shifting from a unipolar order‚Äîdominated by U.S. influence‚Äîto a multipolar framework where power, trade, and capital are distributed across several major regions and alliances.

This transformation is already in motion. BRICS+ central banks are aggressively accumulating gold. Sovereign wealth funds and financial institutions are diversifying away from dollar assets. Citizens in emerging economies are quietly preparing‚Äîturning to hard assets and alternative stores of value in anticipation of a new monetary regime.
**__
This isn't just about economics. It‚Äôs about sovereignty, resilience, and strategic autonomy. And in this new world, gold isn‚Äôt just a hedge‚Äîit‚Äôs a declaration of independence from a system that has run its course.

The monetary reset is coming. The signs are everywhere‚Äîfor those who choose to see them.__**

**üîΩ Support Levels & Bearish Scenario:**
If gold breaks and sustains below ‚Çπ94,834, we may see further downside towards:

**
‚Çπ93,750 (extended support)**

**‚Çπ95300 (resistance)**

**üîº Resistance Levels & Bullish Scenario:**
On the upside, ‚Çπ95,300 remains a strong resistance zone.

If gold manages to bounce from the 50 EMA without breaking it, a retest of ‚Çπ95,300 is likely.

2025-05-28,"**Potential for Operation Twist 2.0?**

If the Federal Reserve were to announce an Operation Twist‚Äîa policy move where it sells short-term U.S. Treasuries (91 days to 2 years maturity) and buys long-term Treasuries (10 to 30 years maturity)‚Äîit could lead to a temporary drop in long-term yields without expanding the money supply or significantly weakening the U.S. Dollar.

Based on the current maturity profile (as of May 21, 2025), the Fed holds approximately $600 billion in Treasuries maturing between 91 days and 2 years, which could be used to finance the purchase of longer-dated bonds. Such an operation could help flatten the yield curve and address concerns around the recent steepening or rise in long-term yields.

üîÅ Operation Twist is not a new concept. It was previously implemented in 1961 and again during 2011‚Äì2012. While the Fed has not hinted at any such move recently, the strategy remains a historical tool the central bank could consider if yield curve dynamics or long-term borrowing costs become a concern.

‚úÖ Key advantage: Adjusts the maturity composition of Fed holdings without changing the size of the balance sheet or injecting new liquidity‚Äîthus avoiding excess pressure¬†on¬†the¬†dollar.

2025-05-29,"**Trump‚Äôs Tariffs Blocked by Court ‚Äî But Don‚Äôt Get Too Comfortable**

So, the US Court of International Trade has decided to play referee and block Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúreciprocal tariffs.‚Äù Apparently, someone remembered that Congress is supposed to handle trade policy ‚Äî a minor detail that's been conveniently ignored since the 1960s.

But let‚Äôs not get too excited. If there's one thing Trump knows how to do, it‚Äôs find the backdoor. Expect some creative executive gymnastics to push this through anyway ‚Äî legal ruling or not.

Meanwhile, businesses are left trying to navigate this circus. Imagine being an American importer today: your goods are on a ship, the rules are changing mid-voyage, and you're just hoping a court ruling doesn‚Äôt blow up your margins overnight. Supply chains don‚Äôt just need resilience ‚Äî they need psychic powers.

This isn‚Äôt the end of the Trump vs. Courts drama. It‚Äôs just the latest episode. The ""America First"" narrative remains alive and well, and it‚Äôs doing a great job of speeding up both deglobalization and dedollarisation.

And for investors? Gold prices might wobble in the short term, but the long game is still shining. When unpredictability is the only constant, hard assets look a lot more attractive than hard politics.

2025-05-29,"**COMEX Gold Market Update**

COMEX Gold August futures rebounded sharply on Thursday, trading above $3,340 per ounce after hitting a one-week low of $3,270 earlier in the session. This recovery is driven by a weaker U.S. dollar and renewed dip-buying interest, as investors reacted to mixed U.S. economic data and escalating trade policy uncertainty. 

The Dollar Index slid to 99.46 following a downward revision in Q1 GDP, which showed a contraction of 0.2% annualized, alongside weaker-than-expected consumer spending and the steepest drop in corporate profits since late 2020.

Moreover, Labor market data added to the bearish economic tone, with initial jobless claims rising by 14,000 to 240,000‚Äîabove consensus‚Äîand continuing claims climbing to their highest level since November 2021. 

Meanwhile, pending home sales slumped 6.3% in April, reversing the prior month‚Äôs gains and marking the sharpest decline in a year.

On the policy front, investor sentiment was buoyed by White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett‚Äôs confidence that the trade court ruling blocking major Trump tariffs would be overturned. However, broader trade tensions remain elevated as the U.S. tightens export controls on China.

Federal Reserve minutes revealed concern over rising inflation, softening growth, and potential recession risks, reinforcing gold‚Äôs appeal as a defensive asset in uncertain times.

Today: Yet another court joins the ‚Äúthese tariffs are illegal‚Äù chorus.

Also today: An appeals court hits pause on the pause, reinstating the tariffs ‚Äî because legal whack-a-mole is now a national pastime.

2025-06-02,"**Gold Market Update**

COMEX gold futures surged over 2.6% on Monday, breaching $3,400 per ounce to mark a three-week high, as a weakening U.S. dollar and a resurgence of geopolitical and economic uncertainty bolstered safe-haven demand. 

The U.S. dollar index extended its decline, falling below 98.7 at the start of June‚Äîapproaching levels last seen in April‚Äîafter closing May modestly lower. 

A combination of renewed trade tensions and disappointing economic data weighed on sentiment. Notably, the ISM Manufacturing PMI indicated a deeper-than-expected contraction for the third consecutive month, reinforcing concerns about the health of the U.S. economy.

Geopolitical tensions escalated after U.S. Trump accused China of reneging on an agreement to roll back tariffs and trade restrictions on critical minerals. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled a potential high-level call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to resolve emerging trade frictions.

Market participants now look to upcoming commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and other policymakers for clarity on the interest rate outlook. 

Gold typically benefits from a low-interest-rate environment and heightened geopolitical risk. Amid escalating trade war fears, fiscal uncertainty, and debt ceiling concerns, investors are positioning defensively, with bullion emerging as a preferred hedge against volatility.

2025-06-02,"Trump Sets July 8 Deadline to Finalize Trade Deals



The Trump Administration has set a firm July 8th deadline to conclude ongoing trade negotiations.

Countries have been urged to submit their best offers by Wednesday to avoid the reinstatement of tariffs.

The tariff pause ends in 36 days, raising the risk of renewed trade tensions if deals are not reached in time.


Our View:


This should come as no surprise to our readers. Since November, we've consistently highlighted that the world is entering the final phase of de-dollarization and a full reversal of U.S.-led globalization.

The traditional global model‚Äîwhere the U.S. printed dollars to fuel an endless cycle of debt-driven consumption and trade‚Äîis drawing to a close. 

What we‚Äôre witnessing is not just tactical trade disputes, but an economic and financial reset.

The U.S.-China decoupling and the ongoing reset in U.S.-EU trade ties are manifestations of this broader shift.

 The rest of the world, is following Bharat, and is steadily moving away from multilateral trade pacts toward bilateral agreements, acknowledging a future where the U.S. dollar is no  longer the sole reserve currency, nor the glue that binds global trade alliances.

The Caixin‚Äôs PMI falling to 48.3, the lowest since September 2022.

Still, Copper prices continue to find support from ongoing supply disruptions in Chile and Africa, where operators have reported logistical challenges and mechanical issues at two Chilean sites.

Aluminium also gave up ground after Monday‚Äôs rise, which was triggered by President Trump‚Äôs announcement to double tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to 50%.

*Momentum eases in May amid market consolidation*

Global gold-backed ETFs recorded net outflows of US$1.8bn in May 2025, ending a five-month streak of consecutive inflows. The pullback, led by North America (-US$1.5bn) and Asia (-US$489mn), coincided with a modest decline in gold prices. In contrast, Europe stood out with net inflows of US$225mn, highlighting regional divergence in investor sentiment.

As a result of the May outflows, total assets under management (AUM) in global gold ETFs declined by 1% to US$374bn, while total holdings fell by 19 tonnes (t), bringing cumulative holdings to 3,541t. Despite the monthly dip, gold ETF flows remain firmly positive year-to-date, with net inflows of US$30bn and a total addition of 322t in holdings.

Notably, Asia reversed the strong inflows witnessed in April, and other regions saw marginal outflows for the first time in six months. Overall, global gold market liquidity remained elevated, suggesting continued investor engagement despite short-term profit-taking and repositioning.

2025-06-06,"Crude oil surged to $64.7/bbl today, highest since April, driven by a combination of geopolitical risks and supply concerns:

Hopes for progress in US-China trade talks have boosted market sentiment, raising expectations of stronger global demand.

US sanctions on Venezuela are constraining oil exports, tightening global supply.

Escalating geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine continue to fuel fears of potential energy supply disruptions.

The possibility of a US-Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities has heightened concerns over broader instability in the Middle East.

A new round of US sanctions against Iran is further amplifying supply-side risks.

Despite this week's 6% rally, traders should remain cautious, as the gains may not be sustainable amid expectations of a potential significant production increase at the upcoming OPEC+ meeting in July. 

The faster-than-expected pace of unwinding output cuts by OPEC+ has raised concerns about a looming glut.

China‚Äôs central bank continued its gold-buying spree in May, adding 60,000 troy ounces or 1.875 ton to its reserves, bringing the total to 73.83 million fine troy ounces, according to data released Saturday. 

This marks the seventh consecutive month of accumulation by the People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBOC), underscoring its ongoing strategy to diversify away from the US dollar amid persistent market uncertainty.

The increase comes as global central banks collectively purchase around 80 metric tons of gold monthly, providing a solid floor for prices, according to Goldman Sachs. While gold has cooled slightly from its April record, it remains near all-time highs due to safe-haven demand driven by trade tensions. Meanwhile, China‚Äôs foreign exchange reserves rose slightly to $3.285 trillion in May from $3.282 trillion in April.

2025-06-09,"**Precious Metals Weekly Update: Silver Steals the Spotlight as Gold Consolidates**


Last week began on a cautious note, weighed down by a series of weak U.S. economic indicators‚Äîmost notably, contractionary ISM manufacturing and services data. However, sentiment received a welcome lift from May‚Äôs non-farm payrolls, which, while showing a moderation in hiring (+139k jobs), also delivered stronger-than-expected wage growth and a steady unemployment rate. This helped reinforce confidence in the underlying resilience of the U.S. labor market.

Adding to the macro momentum, the European Central Bank cut rates by 25 basis points, its first move in years. The policy divergence between the Fed and the ECB gave the U.S. Dollar a lift, particularly against the Euro and other European currencies. The stronger greenback, along with a rebound in U.S. equities and geopolitical optimism around U.S.-China trade talks, weighed on safe-haven demand for gold.

President Trump announced that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet their Chinese counterparts in London this week to resume trade negotiations. While modest, the resumption of dialogue represents a notable shift from the prolonged stalemate that has characterized U.S.-China relations.

Amid this backdrop, spot gold prices corrected from $3400 to $3293. However, the real action last week was in silver, which decisively broke out of a 7.5-month consolidation zone between $29 and $35. The rally was supported by firm copper prices, renewed risk appetite, and broad-based strength in industrial metals. As a result, the gold-silver ratio fell sharply from 100 to 92, returning to early April levels and confirming silver‚Äôs relative strength.


**üî∂ Gold Outlook: Sideways Now, Bullish Later**

Gold remains in a consolidative phase, digesting its previous rally and awaiting fresh catalysts. This week‚Äôs U.S. CPI data could be crucial; a hotter-than-expected print may support the dollar and reduce the probability of near-term Fed rate cuts, thus capping gold‚Äôs upside.

Key Supports: $3280 and $3250

Resistance Levels: $3360 and $3450

**Outlook: Short-term consolidation within a long-term bullish trend**

Target: $4000 by March 2026, driven by central bank accumulation, geopolitical risks, and de-dollarization trends


‚ö™Ô∏è** Silver Outlook: Breakout Confirmed, Momentum Building**

Silver has decisively broken out of its range and is now benefiting from both precious and base metal bullishness. Strong copper prices, improving global sentiment, and a narrowing gold-silver ratio suggest ongoing upside potential.

Immediate Support: $34.50 (now a strong floor)

Medium-Term Target: $39.50 to $40.00

**Medium to Long term Outlook: Bullish**

We remain overweight silver, expecting it to outperform gold over the coming months as both safe-haven and industrial demand converge.

 U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said trade talks with China were progressing well as both sides met for a second day in London, aiming to resolve tensions over export controls. The negotiations follow a preliminary agreement in Geneva last month, where the two countries agreed to roll back some tariffs, easing fears of a full-scale trade war.

The discussions, led by top officials including Lutnick, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, are focused on critical supply chain issues‚Äîparticularly rare earths and semiconductor exports. 

China‚Äôs near-monopoly on rare earth magnets and its recent suspension of exports have disrupted global industries. In response, the U.S. imposed new restrictions on chip-related technology and aviation components.

White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett indicated that the U.S. may lift some export controls if China accelerates rare earth shipments.

However, advanced AI chips from firms like Nvidia will remain restricted due to national security concerns. Both sides are expected to issue updates later today.

Silver has been in a multi-year to multi-decade consolidation, oscillating within a broad range despite macroeconomic shifts. This prolonged basing pattern reflects structural undervaluation relative to other asset classes and inflationary trends.

As the global de-dollarization trend accelerates and potentially culminates by the end of this decade, a significantly weaker US Dollar could act as a powerful catalyst for silver. In such a scenario, silver prices have the potential to surge toward $100/oz, driven by monetary debasement, renewed investor interest, and industrial demand in a green and digital economy.

**Israel is ""fully ready"" to launch a military operation against Iran, U.S.
officials confirm, while Tehran has prepared a retaliatory strike targeting Israel in the event of an attack.** (Bloomberg)

     A senior Iranian official said on Thursday morning that a ""friendly""
country in the region has alerted Tehran about a potential Israeli attack/

     The New York Times reported on Thursday that senior Iranian military and government officials have already convened to discuss a plan of action in the
event of such an attack, which would include a barrage of hundreds of ballistic missiles targeting Israel.

     This comes after CBS News reported that multiple sources have confirmed U.S. officials were informed that Israel is ""fully ready"" to launch a military
operation against Iran.

     According to NBC, a potential Israeli strike may come without U.S. support.

     A source familiar with the matter told NBC that Israel may be in a
position to take unilateral action against Tehran, despite Israel's reliance on U.S. intelligence or other direct and logistical assistance.

     NBC also said that sources ""were not aware of any planned U.S. involvement in the possible action.""

     According to the CBS report, Washington believes Iran may retaliate by targeting certain American sites in neighboring Iraq.
     
Both Israeli officials and White House spokespeople declined to comment,
CBS added.

     In response to heightened regional tensions, the U.S. embassy in Iraq is preparing for an evacuation, an Iraqi security official and a U.S. source told
Reuters on Wednesday.

     The U.S. State Department also began preparations to evacuate
nonessential embassy personnel and family members from Bahrain and Kuwait, the Associated Press reported.

     Commenting on the rising tensions on Wednesday, Trump said the region ""could be a dangerous place,"" adding that the United States would not allow
Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.
     
Also on Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was less confident that Iran would agree to stop uranium enrichment in a nuclear deal with Washington.

     ""I don't know,"" Trump told the ""Pod Force One"" podcast on Monday when asked if he thought he could get Iran to agree to shut down its nuclear program. ""I don't know. I did think so, and I'm getting more and more ‚Äì less confident about it.""

The Government of India has reduced the Basic Customs Duty (BCD) on crude edible oils‚Äînamely crude sunflower, soybean, and palm oils‚Äîfrom 20% to 10%. 

This move widens the import duty differential between crude and refined edible oils from 8.75% to 19.25%, aiming to curb soaring edible oil prices triggered by last year‚Äôs duty hike and rising global prices. The measure is designed to lower the landed cost of imports, reduce retail prices, and ease food inflation, while encouraging domestic refining and discouraging refined oil imports. 

The Department of Food and Public Distribution (DFPD) has directed industry associations to ensure immediate price adjustments in Price to Distributors (PTD) and Maximum Retail Prices (MRP), requesting weekly brand-wise MRP data. 

This strategic intervention not only supports consumer welfare but also strengthens domestic refining capacities, ensuring a balanced supply chain and fair returns for farmers amid volatile global markets.

The U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) rose just 0.1% in May, below expectations of 0.2%, while initial jobless claims held at an eight-month high and continuing claims surged to their highest since November 2021, both surpassing forecasts. These signals of a cooling labor market, coupled with weaker CPI and PPI data, boosted expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut by September, with markets now pricing in 50 basis points of easing in 2025. 

Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions flared after the U.S. ordered embassy staff to leave Baghdad amid threats from Iran to strike U.S. bases if nuclear talks fail. 

Further uncertainty arose as President Trump announced plans to send tariff-related letters to major trading partners in the coming weeks.

The escalation has intensified market fears of potential supply disruptions from the region, despite official reassurances.

However, the National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company (NIORDC), in a statement reported by IRNA, confirmed that no damage had been sustained by Iran‚Äôs oil refining or storage facilities. 

The company emphasized that fuel supply operations remain uninterrupted across the country and continue in a sustainable manner. 

NIORDC also extended condolences for the loss of commanders, scientists, and civilians in the strikes. While infrastructure remains intact for now, markets remain sensitive to the risk of further instability in the region.

COMEX August gold futures surged to a seven-week high of $3,468 per ounce before paring gains to trade near $3,445, following the release of stronger-than-expected U.S. consumer sentiment data. The University of Michigan‚Äôs index rose sharply to 60.5 in June 2025, up from 52.2 in April and May, and above forecasts of 53.5. This marked the first rise in sentiment in six months, with gains in both current conditions and future expectations. Year-ahead inflation expectations fell to 5.1% from 6.6% in May, while the five-year outlook eased to 4.1%, reflecting reduced fears about tariff-driven inflation.

Gold futures remain up around 3% this week, on track for a record settlement high as investors flock to safe-haven assets amid heightened Middle East tensions. Israel‚Äôs preemptive strike on Iran targeting its nuclear program intensified fears of broader conflict. Additional support came from soft U.S. inflation data and growing prospects of further Federal Reserve rate cuts, alongside uncertainty over U.S. trade policy under President Trump‚Äôs tariff threats.

The geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have intensified following Israel‚Äôs recent military operations targeting Iran‚Äôs nuclear and military infrastructure. 

Esmail Kosari, a senior member of Iran‚Äôs parliamentary security commission, stated on Saturday that Tehran is ‚Äúseriously‚Äù considering the closure of the *Strait of Hormuz*‚Äîa critical chokepoint for global oil trade. 

The Strait facilitates around 21 million barrels of oil per day, accounting for 21% of global oil flows, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (2022 data).

Israel launched preemptive strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites, including Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, citing security concerns. In response, Iran has begun retaliatory measures, with the conflict shifting its primary front from Gaza to Iran. 

*Iranian Atomic Energy Organization* spokesperson Behrouz Kamalvandi confirmed only limited damage at Fordow, stressing that most sensitive equipment had been relocated earlier, and no contamination occurred. 

The international community continues to call for de-escalation as fears of broader regional instability grow.

Reports suggesting Tehran‚Äôs openness to resume nuclear talks with the U.S. briefly supported risk sentiment. However, this was undermined by Iranian officials denying any diplomatic outreach and renewed threats from Tehran, including warnings of a ‚Äúvery big blow‚Äù against Israel and evacuation alerts in Tel Aviv.

On data front, the Empire State Manufacturing Index plunged to -16 in June, far below expectations, signaling deepening weakness in New York‚Äôs business activity. Declines in new orders and shipments highlight deteriorating demand and supply chain pressures.

Meanwhile, markets await the Fed‚Äôs rate decision. While rates are expected to remain steady, attention will center on the updated economic projections. With inflation cooling and labor markets softening, expectations are growing for a potential rate cut as early as September. Uncertainty remains high across geopolitical and economic fronts.

In the fog of war and geopolitics, price charts often serve as early indicators‚Äîforeshadowing events before they hit headlines. We've observed time and again that key chart formations and price action in crude oil have preceded major geopolitical and macroeconomic developments.

Right now, with news surrounding Israel and Iran coming in rapidly, the WTI crude oil price chart is offering important cues. As things stand, the technical picture is bearish, with lower highs and a descending trendline firmly intact. The worst-case scenario of a Strait of Hormuz blockade appears unlikely at present, and market pricing reflects that view.

However, should WTI reclaim and sustain above the $71.00‚Äì$72.00 zone, it could be a signal that smart money is repositioning for potential escalation‚Äîpossibly anticipating supply disruptions or broader conflict impacts.

For now:

**Key Resistance: $71.00 and $72.00

Key Support: $68.00, $66.30, and $64.50**

2025-06-18,"**Today's US Data impact**

US housing data for May 2025 points to a deepening slowdown in residential construction, adding weight to expectations of a Fed rate cut later this year. **Housing starts** fell sharply by 9.8% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.256 million units, the lowest level since May 2020 and well below consensus forecasts of 1.36 million. **Building permits**, a leading indicator of future activity, declined 2% to 1.393 million units, their weakest reading since June 2020. 

Elevated mortgage rates and tariffs on imported materials have significantly dampened builder confidence and housing demand, signaling further headwinds for the real estate sector.

**Initial jobless** claims offered little relief, edging down by 5,000 to 245,000 for the week ending June 14th, but still representing one of the highest readings since August 2023. Continuing claims held near a three-year high at 1.945 million, reinforcing concerns about softening labor market conditions.

These data collectively bolster the case for a more dovish Fed stance, as evidence of slowing housing activity and persistent labor market strain point to moderating economic momentum. 

For bullion traders, signs of economic weakness and potential monetary easing should support gold and silver prices as investors seek safe-haven assets. 

Crude oil traders, however, should remain cautious; weaker construction and labor demand could weigh on fuel consumption in the medium term, even as supply-side dynamics drive short-term price movements.

for the first time since the war started almost a week ago, a
reminder of the risks to civilians in both countries. Israel‚Äôs
Health Ministry said there were only a number of light injuries
in the incident at Soroka Medical Center in the south of the
country, as the missile landed in a department that had been
evacuated just hours earlier.

Israel will exact ‚Äúthe full price‚Äù from the Iranian administration for the strike, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. 

US President Donald Trump has for days publicly mused about
joining Israel‚Äôs strikes on Iran, a move that would escalate the
conflict in the oil-rich Middle East. 

The situation is evolving
and could change, said the people, who requested anonymity to
discuss private talks.  

Israel said it would escalate attacks on Iranian strategic
and government targets ‚Äúto remove threats to the State of Israel
and undermine the Iranian regime,‚Äù Defense Minister Israel Katz
said. 

‚ÄúKhamenei will be held accountable,‚Äù he added, directly
naming Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 

The comments indicate a widening of Israel‚Äôs war objective
beyond the destruction of Iran‚Äôs nuclear program, and the
country‚Äôs campaign showed no signs of letting up. (Bloomberg)",telegram,negative,0.7691891193389893,-0.10569364340782167,-0.10569364340782167,0.13977271,-0.8779,0.0,1.0,0,0

LME spreads are flashing deeper backwardation in copper, as supply disruptions collide with tariff uncertainty and dwindling LME inventories, which are at 13-month lows. 

Copper‚Äôs cash-to-three-month spread has surged to $133.36/ton, the widest since 2022, driven by a near 60% plunge in LME inventories YTD. 

This sharp premium reflects that the market is undersupplied and rising the risk of a short squeeze, exacerbated by mine disruptions in Chile and the DRC, reduced South American cathode exports, and a surge in US copper imports ahead of a potential tariff decision. 

With June delivery approaching, traders scrambling for scarce metal are bidding up spot prices, steepening the curve despite softer macro data from China. 

Additionally, Chinese smelters are reportedly preparing to export copper to capitalize on elevated international prices, potentially intensifying onshore tightness.

This tightening backdrop, coupled with geopolitical uncertainties and mixed macro data from China, is keeping spreads elevated as traders navigate an increasingly stressed metals market.

2025-06-20,"**Fed Governor Waller says central bank could cut rates as early as July**

Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said on Friday that the Fed could consider cutting interest rates as early as July. He noted that inflation doesn‚Äôt seem to be rising much due to President Donald Trump‚Äôs new tariffs, so the central bank should focus on supporting the job market. 

Waller argued it‚Äôs better to act early to prevent any slowdown in employment rather than wait for serious trouble. While Waller favors a cautious, gradual rate cut, the Fed‚Äôs recent decision was to hold rates steady at 4.25%-4.5%. 

The central bank‚Äôs outlook shows mixed views, with most officials expecting two cuts this year, but no clear agreement. 

Trump has been pressuring the Fed for deeper cuts, calling for rates at least 2 percentage points lower. 

However, CME Group's FedWatch, suggests the first cut is more likely in September than in July.

2025-06-23,"It‚Äôs important to recognize that such military strikes are rarely impulsive‚Äîthey are the outcome of years of war-gaming and strategic planning. Behind the scenes, it is highly likely that backchannel communications are already underway involving key regional players including Israel, Iran, major Asian powers, the U.S., and the EU, all working to prevent a wider escalation that benefits no one.

While we may witness a sharp rise in volatility across oil, bullion, and broader financial markets in the immediate aftermath, there is reason to believe that these moves could be contained‚Äîassuming diplomatic channels remain active and the situation doesn't spiral.

2025-06-23,"Iran‚Äôs next move will define the market narrative. A total shutdown of the Strait of Hormuz still looks unlikely, but a ‚Äúcalibrated-disruption‚Äù playbook is very much on the table: harassment of merchant ships, proxy-led mini-blockades, scattered mines, drone fly-bys, or even limited missile strikes on tankers and nearby ports. Each tactic stays just below the threshold of open war yet is potent enough to jolt prices.

Insurance rates for crude passing through Hormuz have already inched higher; a fresh escalation could send premiums soaring on ‚Äúdirty‚Äù cargoes, making shipments uneconomical and discouraging some tankers from entering the corridor‚Äîcrimping volumes in the process.

The next 48-72 hours are critical. A muted Iranian response would likely let oil retrace after the initial spike. Anything less restrained could usher in a new, higher-volatility regime for energy markets.

2025-06-23,"WTI crude oil prices surged earlier today, reaching a five-month high of $78.4 per barrel amid possibility of Iranian retaliation following the US airstrikes on Iran‚Äôs three key nuclear sites over the weekend.

Iran had already issued warnings that it had mobilized missiles and military assets to target U.S. bases across the region if the U.S. directly engaged in hostilities.

Despite the initial spike, oil prices have since retreated from their intraday highs and are currently trading around $75 per barrel.

However, traders remain on edge, as the situation is still unfolding.

There is a heightened risk of Iran retaliating against oil infrastructure in the region or taking actions that could impact global oil supply routes.

On Sunday, Iran‚Äôs parliament passed a motion to close the Strait of Hormuz, one of the world‚Äôs most critical oil chokepoints, now requires approval from the Supreme National Security Council and the Supreme Leader before it can be implemented.

The Strait of Hormuz is vital to the global energy supply, with nearly 20% of the world‚Äôs crude oil exports passing through it. 

Any attempt to block this route would likely send oil prices soaring and severely impact global markets.

**Nevertheless, shutting down the strait could backfire on Iran itself, as more than half of Iran‚Äôs own oil exports also rely on this passage. Doing so would deal a significant blow to Iran‚Äôs already fragile economy**.

2025-06-24,"**Powell signals patience on rate cuts as Fed monitors tariff-driven inflation risks**

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated on Tuesday that the central bank is in no rush to cut interest rates, as it closely monitors the potential inflationary impacts of higher tariffs. Speaking before the House Financial Services Committee, Powell emphasized that the Fed expects tariff-related price increases to start emerging over the summer, particularly in the June and July inflation readings. He stressed the importance of waiting for clearer data before making policy adjustments, citing a still-strong labor market and significant uncertainty surrounding the final shape of US trade policy.

While some FOMC members recently hinted at the possibility of a July rate cut, Powell firmly declined to commit to action at any specific meeting. He underlined that the Fed‚Äôs role is not to comment on trade policy, but to manage inflation risks arising from such policies. Powell noted that professional forecasters widely anticipate a meaningful rise in inflation this year, warranting a cautious approach. His testimony prompted markets to scale back expectations for a July rate cut, shifting bets towards September. The Fed‚Äôs most recent projections continue to signal two rate cuts in 2025, aligning with prevailing market expectations.

In Asian markets on Wednesday, gold prices edged up modestly, bouncing back after a steep drop the day before. The recent easing of geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, combined with a weaker U.S. dollar, provided some support, although renewed investor risk appetite limited gains.

Gold had fallen more than 1% on Tuesday following President Donald Trump‚Äôs announcement of a phased ceasefire between Israel and Iran.

The truce dampened gold‚Äôs appeal as a safe-haven asset, yet ongoing uncertainty and a softer U.S. dollar helped keep prices steady. The Dollar Index dipped 0.1% in Asian hours, hovering close to its lowest level in a week.

In May 2025, the U.S. housing sector showed significant signs of weakness, with **new single-family home sales** plunging by 13.7% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 623,000 units. This sharp drop, the steepest since June 2022, reversed April‚Äôs revised 9.6% gain and fell well short of expectations near 700,000 units.

On the energy front, U.S. commercial **crude oil inventories** (excluding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) fell by 5.8 million barrels to 415.1 million barrels for the week ending June 20, placing them 11% below the five-year seasonal average.

2025-06-26,"A key one-day copper price spread surged to the highest level in four years on the LME, placing fresh strains on buyers contending with a rapid decline in inventories.

Contracts due in one day traded at a $98 a ton premium to those expiring a day later, hitting the highest level since an historic short squeeze that rocked the LME in 2021.

The burgeoning supply squeeze has been fueled by US
President Donald Trump‚Äôs plans to impose import tariffs on the
metal. 

The proposal ‚Äî which was formally set in motion in February ‚Äî has caused copper prices to rocket in New York, and traders have been shipping record volumes to the US to take advantage of the surge before any levies are imposed.

That trend has drained inventories in the rest of the world, and Goldman Sachs analysts warned on Thursday that shortages will get worse before levies come into effect, with the bank expecting a decision by September.  

The spike in the so-called Tom/next spread ‚Äî known as a
backwardation ‚Äî can impose huge losses on traders and industrial
hedgers with short positions on the LME. 

It creates an incentive
for shorts to deliver metal against their contracts rather than
buying them back at high prices, and rolling them forward at a
loss.

With readily available LME inventories now reaching
critically low levels after declines of nearly 80% this year,
there‚Äôs very little copper on hand for shorts to close out their
positions. 

The huge backwardation on Tom/next and other longer-
dated spreads reflect the growing cost of buying themselves out
of their obligation to deliver.

Outright copper prices also rallied strongly on Thursday,
with the LME‚Äôs benchmark three-month contract climbing more than 2%. Prices jumped as much as 3.7% in New
York, outstripping gains on the LME and creating even stronger
incentives for traders to ship metal to the US. (Bloomberg)",telegram,positive,0.804471492767334,0.17020071850776672,0.17020071850776672,-0.15031856,-0.2732,1.0,1.0,1,0
2025-06-26,"Alongside a supply squeeze, rising expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts are also supporting copper and other dollar-denominated commodities.

If Core PCE increases by just 0.1% in May for a third consecutive month, as expected, it would mark the most subdued three-month stretch since 2020.

Fed Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said she‚Äôs
seeing increasing evidence that tariffs may not lead to a large
or sustained inflation surge, helping bolster the case for a rate cut in the fall. Meantime, her Richmond counterpart Tom Barkin said he expects tariffs will put upward pressure on prices, and with so much still uncertain, the central bank should wait for more clarity before adjusting rates.",telegram,neutral,0.7486302852630615,0.002933829259872456,0.002933829259872456,-0.71253234,0.296,1.0,1.0,0,0

The **U.S. economy** contracted by 0.5% in Q1 2025, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis' final estimate, marking a steeper decline than the previous 0.2% estimate. The downward revision was attributed to weaker consumer spending and exports, partially offset by reduced imports. Real final sales to private domestic purchasers rose 1.9%, slowing by 0.6 percentage points from the prior quarter, while inflation ticked slightly higher, with the PCE price index at 3.7% y/y and core PCE at 3.5%.

Labor market indicators revealed signs of cooling. **Initial jobless claims** declined by 10,000 to 236,000 for the week ending June 21, yet remained above the year‚Äôs average. Continuing claims climbed by 37,000 to 1.974 million‚Äîthe highest since November 2021‚Äîsignaling increasing challenges for job seekers.

Manufacturing showed strength, with **new orders** surging 16.4% in May to $343.6 billion, driven by a 230.8% jump in non defense aircraft. Housing data also reflected modest improvement, with pending home sales rising 1.8% m/m, led by a 6% gain in the West.

Meanwhile, **working natural gas storage** rose by 96 bcf to 2,898 bcf, remaining well above the five-year average, despite a yearly decline of 196 bcf.

The core PCE index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, climbed 2.7% year-on-year, slightly higher than April‚Äôs 2.5%. On a monthly basis, both headline and core PCE inflation rose by 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively.

These figures suggest that while consumers are becoming cautious amid economic uncertainty, inflation remains sticky, potentially complicating the Fed‚Äôs decision on future rate cuts.

According to the CME FedWatch Tool, 79% of market participants anticipate the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady at its July meeting. 

This view is consistent with recent comments from a majority of Fed officials, who have expressed caution and pushed back against a July rate cut, citing concerns that tariffs and other price pressures could have a delayed impact on inflation.

2025-06-30,"**Comex Gold Futures Update**

Comex August gold futures declined sharply by over 1.8% on Friday, settling below $3,288 per ounce‚Äîthe lowest in a month‚Äîand posting a second consecutive weekly loss. The sell-off was driven by improved global risk sentiment following a new U.S.-China trade agreement that included provisions to expedite rare earth shipments to the U.S., sparking a broad-based rally in equities and reducing demand for safe-haven assets like gold.

Geopolitical tensions eased as well, with a ceasefire between Israel and Iran largely holding, further dampening risk aversion. 

On the macro front, U.S. consumer spending unexpectedly declined in May, reflecting cooling post-tariff demand, while inflation remained moderate. However, consumer sentiment surged to a four-month high, with improving inflation expectations.

Gold partially recovered from its lows after President Trump abruptly ended trade talks with Canada and threatened new tariffs in response to Ottawa's digital services tax. Additionally, weaker-than-expected U.S. personal spending and income data, along with dovish remarks from Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari‚Äîwho projected two 25-bp rate cuts in 2025‚Äîbolstered gold‚Äôs appeal. ETF inflows, which pushed gold holdings to a 21-month high, further supported the metal.

Nonetheless, expectations of sustained higher interest rates continue to pressure bullion, given its non-yielding nature.

In contrast, the *ISM Manufacturing PMI* remained below the 50-mark at 49, indicating a fourth straight month of contraction. While production and inventories improved, employment and new orders weakened further. Supplier delays eased, but price pressures linked to tariffs persisted.

Meanwhile, *US job openings* jumped to 7.77 million in May, far exceeding expectations, especially in services and finance. This robust labor demand supports a strong economy.

These data reduce the likelihood of an immediate Fed rate cut, as inflation risks persist. For gold, this means mixed signals‚Äîwhile inflation typically supports gold, delayed rate cuts strengthen the dollar, potentially capping gold‚Äôs upside.

**Weak private sector jobs data fuels Fed rate cut expectations**

The U.S. private sector shed 33,000 jobs in June, as per the latest ADP National Employment Report, falling short of market expectations. The decline was primarily driven by job losses in professional, business, education, and health services, which collectively cut 66,000 positions. ADP Chief Economist Nela Richardson noted that while layoffs remain relatively low, firms are hesitant to hire or replace departing staff, signaling a cooling labor market.

Separately, data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported 47,999 job cuts in June, down 49% from May but still reflective of ongoing economic strain. The retail sector saw a 255% year-over-year spike in layoffs, while the federal government slashed 288,628 jobs, many still under legal review.

This softening labor market strengthens the case for a Federal Reserve rate cut, likely weighing on the U.S. dollar and supporting gold prices due to lower yields and inflation expectations. While subdued hiring pressures economic momentum, it could offer relief from wage-driven inflation, aiding the Fed‚Äôs path to policy easing and helping stabilize broader economic conditions.

2025-07-03,"**Today's U.S. economic data points to a steady labor market and modest growth in services, which may lead the Federal Reserve to delay any immediate interest rate cuts.**

In June 2025, nonfarm payrolls rose by 147,000‚Äîstronger than expected and in line with the yearly average‚Äîmainly supported by government hiring, especially in education. While jobless claims declined slightly, the number of people continuing to claim benefits remained high, suggesting that some workers are still struggling to find new jobs.

The unemployment rate unexpectedly dropped to 4.1%, showing labor market stability despite a slight drop in workforce participation. At the same time, the ISM Services PMI returned to expansion at 50.8, with growth in new orders and business activity, although firms still cited concerns over rising costs and tariffs.

Overall, the strength in jobs and services reduces the urgency for the Fed to cut rates soon. For gold, this means limited upside in the near term, as higher interest rates make non-yielding assets like gold less attractive. Without clear signs of economic stress or Fed easing, gold‚Äôs appeal as a safe haven may be capped.
